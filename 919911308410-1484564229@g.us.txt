Guys whats difference between cs and cis
?
How much time do graduate advisors take to respond to our email? Any idea? ðŸ˜…
1 day or same day depends what time you mail them
In India time, if you mail them after 6 pm, which means morning for them.. They will reply in 3 4 hours which means by midnight in India
That's what I used to do
It's been 4 days now, they haven't responded ðŸ˜•
Guys?
Lot of people mail them
I got admit for computer and information science
Is it cs or cis?
Did u all got the same admit?
Your mail must be overflowed with others mails
Mail during the time I said.. You will get the reply
ðŸ‘
On same day or by next day morning
In my mail it's computer science MS non thesis
Yeah same doubt
On i20 chexk
Its written computer and information science
Mine is exactly same as yours
It's same for everyone
Mine too has computer and information science

Visa Experience  Date: 01/06/2017  Consulate: Chennai- approved  University: UTA  Course: MS in CS  Time slot : 9.30am  Â   I reached the consulate early at around 9.m. There was only 1 common queue for all types of visa. Waiting in line is the time consuming part. The interview lasts only a couple of minutes. I finished the interview and came out by 10.30The visa officer was an American in his 30s.  Â Was waiting in the Q. The guy in front of me was also an F1. He started well but fumbled n gave 2 bad answers n got rejected.Then me   Me: Good Morning..how are you doing today  VO: Good Morning,.I'm good how are you. Me: I'm fine too thank you...(Passing i20, sevis fees n passport)  VO: Why UTA?  Me: UTA first of all has a good ranking. I'm very much interested in the coursework like artificial intelligence, database, big data and information security. There are some eminent professors like xxx who are currently conducting research on Xxxx and learning the subjects from them will be helpful for me.  (In mean time VO is busy searching my entire passport)  VO: Do you have any other visa?  Me: Yes I have a visitor visa which is in my old passport..(and gave the same)  VO: Have you ever been to US before?  Me: Yes with my family on a tourist visit   VO: Which place did you visit?  ME: we first went to Milwaukee where my sister stays and also visited other cities like New York,Chicago,Washington   VO: How r u funding your studies?  Me: I have an education loan for xx  lacs which takes care of the total expenses and along with that I have a family funding of xx thousand dollars approximately and together it will be completely sufficient to take care of both of my tution and living expenses.  VO: What does your parents do?  Me: My father was running his own business which he closed 2-3 years back n currently earning rent   VO: How are you going to fund your education?  (Types for a few seconds)  VO: What r u going to do after completing the program?  ME: once. Complete my MS after 2 years I will return back to India and rejoin my current organization xxx and stay with my family   VO: Your Visa is approved. Do not forget to show your F1 visa first and not the B2 visa in the immigration else it will confuse why you are having an i20  Me: Thank you so much. Have a good one   VO: smiles
Congratulations Prasad! ðŸ‘ðŸ½

Congrats @919600318534  n @919972452211
Guys need help
Anyone who has biometric scheudled on 22???
@919600318534 congratulations!!ðŸ˜„
Thanks guys
One thing I realized..be really confident..dress very professional..first impression best impression...give a clear view of funds to show u have a good financial background 95% clear
But did they check your financial documents even?
Nope
A formal wear is compulsory?
Not compulsory..well I saw a student in t shirt n jeans n wearing a Chappal....it looked so bad....with a formal look..it shows a good image
But did he get rejected?
I donno that... Its just a suggestion for creating a first impression...in corporates casuals are not encouraged..it gives a bad impression especially in interviews
So how did you give away an expression of being heavily funded? Because I'm a nervous person so it's hard to make a good steady first impression even if I would have enough financial background in papers  ðŸ™ˆ
Wear some bling ðŸ¤£
Keep ur cool no matter how bad the situation is..be having a smile..keep clear eye contacts
It's ground rule in physiology if one is lying they don't speak with clear eye contacts
Got it!! Thanks and congrats on your visa ðŸ˜€
Sure thing now :P
Guys do you know how many times can you reschedule your interview dates?
And is it possible to reschedule your consulate interview after going for the biometric one
I guess you  can't reschedule after biometric
Ok thx
Any senior on the group- The departmental orientation is conducted only once or they have miltiple dates like the international one?
When is department orientation
Congratulations prasad!
Ya coz they've already put a sticker on your passport with a date for your VI ðŸ˜…
*psychology
Yeah but that doesn't me you should stare into VO's soul. Just be chill :p
Guys what all is required for getting I20? Financial documents and?
Passport copy
Alright
Anything else?
And those forms u need to fill out
Which forms?
You mean the online upload?
Oh ok that I20 form
Alright
Sorry
Thanks a lot!
http://www.uta.edu/admissions/graduate/forms/international/index.php
Fantastic
Thanks a lot
Guys all those that got their visa approved. Did you show tax returns or invoices ?
Tax returns I had in hand.. but they didnt check the docs at all
They would require if they ask... keep it handy.
Ok. Thanks
Visa experience  Consulate :Mumbai  Date: 02/06/2017 Time: 10.00am Counter: 26 Status: Approved Was sent in as soon as I reached. VO was a guy in mid 30s.  ME: Good Morning Sir. Gave my passport, sevis and i20. VO: (No reaction) Started scanning my i20 and passport. So when did you complete your UG ? ME: In 2014 Sir. VO: So what have you been doing since then ? ME: I have been working at L&T Infotech for the past 2.5 years as a Software engineer. VO: Okay, How many universities did you apply to ? ME: I applied to 6 universities and received 3 admits. VO: Okay, So here you have mentioned that your Mother will sponsor you, is that correct? ME: Yes sir , my mother and my sister are going to sponsor me. VO: So what does your mother do ? ME: My mother is a housewife and we have XX lacs in savings and my sister is a manager at indigo airlines. VO: Your father passed away is that right? ME: Yes sir. VO: What did he do before he passed away ?  ME: He was a Chartered Accountant. VO: Sorry can you tell me where does your sister work again ? ME: She is a customer relationships manager at Indigo airlines. VO: (Expressions changed from confident to dicey. Should I approve or should I not.) So do you have any education loan ? ME: Yes sir I have taken education loan of 30lacs. VO: Okay your visa is approved. You'll get a message in 2-3 days. ME: Thank you Sir !
Congrats
How did he got to know that your mother is sponsoring you? I20 or from DS
I guess from ds160.
There are a few things that you cannot figure out how do they know about you !
Okay
I guess it cud be from i20... Coz I had written my father will sponsor n and in the interview by mistake I said "I have funds" ... So she referred my i20 and said here it's written father..
i20 had father as the sponsor
Thanks !!
Tasa asel mag..
Oh okay
I think it might depend on vo to vo
Congratulations @917798999628 !
Thank you @919870091293 !

Everyone from CS dept have got the email.. Check ur outlook guys for those who haven't checked it yet
It is mentioned in the mail that students who fall into the category of 30 credits have to take 3 "required" courses. Students with unconditional admits should also complete those courses?
Unconditional admits don't have to do anything..
Guys what is the subject for that mail ?
ðŸ‘

Guys I have a provisional admit and I have to take one prerequisite and send 7th and 8th sem marksheets! Haven't gotten any of the two.. so any idea when's the last date? Also 7th sem mein can I send a true copy with the college's stamp and everything?
Hey does anyone know the phone number and email address to be filled for grad admission counselor Arrin Hines in us point of contact info in ds160
U can get it from the uta portal.. check the grad advisors list..
U will have her email and phone num..
Not sure why her name is not present in grad advisor list, staff directory and international grad counselor list. But found her contact details from uta outlook directory
Cool..ðŸ‘ðŸ½
Guys small help. For visa interview should we take class 10 and class 12 marks sheet ?
Yeah all marksheets
Ok thanks.


Okay
Even I have the same pre requisite. I think we can waive it off if we pass the exam
Exactly
Really ? Is that possible ?
Yes. You have to meet your graduate advisor and tell him that you have studied it
He'll tell you to take the exam
All this has to be done before 24th August
Once the sem starts you cannot do anything about your pre requisite. You'll have to take it
Anyone has the course fee structure? Please send it asap
That's cool. ðŸ‘ðŸ» Thanks man

Hi guys
ðŸ˜‘ðŸ˜‘
Iam having conditional admit with 3 pre requisites
And I am having gre apti score less than 150
Do I have to take 36 credits or 45?
Every sem u pay 9k?
Yes.. Acc to i20 the tuition is around 18k for the 1st year (9 months)
Ok
Guyz max we can take 9-12 credits per sem right..which is 9-12 hrs of class per week..am i right??
1 subject 15 hrs per week I think
Are u sure??
Lucky mascot of UTA is BLAZE right?
But what it meansðŸ˜…
yes
The horse i guess.
Its a horse
Ok..but when I google it it shows some burning kind of Bird
It's a horse
Dw
It's a horse
That blaze is different
Ok...
Don't say horse, say maverick ðŸ˜
It's a horse
It's a horse
1 subject = 3 credits No of credits per sem = no of hrs per week of classes
Maverick = MaverickÂ is a term, usually referring toÂ cattle, *(horse)*, for an animal that does not carry aÂ brand
The animal is horse but it's not just any horse, it's a maverick ðŸ˜Ž
Horse
That's roughly 45hrs per week isn't it
In 1 sem say you took 4 subjects,  4 subjects = 12 credits = 12 hrs per week
Bhai, 45 hrs per week>> 9 hrs per day ðŸ˜³ Thoda zada hogayi padhai ðŸ˜…
U will have 12 hrs of total per week??
It's not even 3 hrs a day??
U don't have lectures daily
Anyways your majority time in any week will be gone in doing the assignments they give every week
No bro, how we split 36 hrs?

If you're talking in terms of credits then, say you take 9 credits each sem (36 credits in total), then 9 hrs of lecture per week.
Remaining time you can Partyyyyy ðŸ˜ŽðŸºðŸ»
ðŸ˜ŽðŸºðŸº
U would have enough assignments to ruin Ur party
A man can dream â˜¹ðŸ˜¢
ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ˜
+1
There is one more problem for us, the ones with pre requisites .. To get a summer internship we should have completed half the number of credits at least.
This might impact our placement prospects
1 credit per sem = 1hr?
Why ? CPT ?
Pre requisites credits are not considered .
Won't be a problem. You can apply for fall and spring internships too. Fall internships are better than summer
But summer is the longest vacation we ll have right ? What to do in that time if we aren't interning !ðŸ˜•
Partyyy
ðŸºðŸ˜œ
ðŸ˜ŽðŸºðŸ»ðŸ¤£
You can take summer classes
You can take 2 courses in summer
So 18 credits atleast should be completed in 1st 2 semesters right?
Yes. But I don't think the pre req credits are considered
Our grad advisor has to Approve for a CPT or whatever and they might deny if we haven't completed enough no of credits from our major
What is the maximum number of credits per semester that we're allowed to take? ðŸ¤”
Please take in terms of courses
Don't talk in terms of credits
You can take max 4 subjects per sem
*courses I mean
Each would consist of 3 credits?!? Right?
Yes.
I heard I can waive off my pre requisites before 24th August if I talk to the grad advisor and take an exam.
True.
Gotta start studying then ðŸ™ˆ
Theory of comp faculty is tough I heard .. We better start studying
Any idea abt the syllabus or text books  to refer ??
Will ask my friend and let know
Sure thanks
Are we Allowed to carry bags for the ofc?

Guys on DS-160 do we have to fill current address or permanent address??
They'll make u keep it outside the Consulate...so better carry a harmonium folder for all ur docs
Even for OFC bags are to be kept outside the centers
Outside as in lockers?
I do have a harmonium folder
I went for Kolkata OFC...there we were asked to put in our cellphones and electronic gadgets in our bags/umbrellas and keep it just outside their office....The belongings kept outside being our responsibility
No lockers in Kolkata...dnt kno abt other OFC centers
Oh okay. Thanks a lot
What about Mumbai ofc?
No probs bro....Hav a dashing interview !!
Thanks againðŸ˜…
Did any of you receive any mail regarding the department orientation?
Yes. By one mr Roberto
Address on your Passport
Thats international Orientation right??
Nope for department based.
In mail it said for graduate advisor right
In that mail it comprised of the schedule and a form to fill and scan it back
Ya thats true..it said for grad advisor..

Congratulations
Guys who have given their VI, even if we stammered a little bit under pressure will that result in visa rejection.
Does everything have to be smooth from start to end
Coz I have my VI tomorrow and I'm Freaking the fuck out ðŸ™‚
No. Stammering is fine. Even I stammered for my VI. They also know that you are nervous. As long as you answer the questions they ask truthfully you should be fine.
But try not to take long pauses
Is the accent an issue over microphone
?
No. No accent issue
Infact one guy VI even I could not follow his english. Clearly he had some difficulty in speaking it but he was clear on what he wanted to speak.
Thanks for the insights, and Congrats on the Visa ðŸ˜Š
So as long as you answer the questions they asked it will be alright. Be yourself. It will make you less nervous
Hi Rishi
Priyank here.
CongratulationsðŸ‘ðŸ»
You too are going on UTA I-20?
Guys we have 30 credits?
What the phuck does she means?
She is expert then believe her or contact khalili
Many people are saying its 36
And staff are saying 30
Wtf is happening
Non thesis is 36 credits course
Ask ur grad advisors
If you your course includes thesis then 30 credits.
Even if it is non thesis, you can qualidy for the 30 credits course. There are 2 requirements.
Everyone will be mailed that document
The gre requirements na?
Verbal above 145 or quants above 160
Either of the two
Yeah.. Are u sure it's either? Or its both?
Sorry, its both.
Please go through the 3rd page
I am gonna get English training i20 since it's already june. I dont even know how it works. Is there anyone who got their visa with that?
Can anyone help with the 30 Hrs Vs 36 Hrs debate?
What if someone is eligible for 30 Hrs course and what if he is not??
Thank You @918411000368 ðŸ˜
Thank You, guysðŸ˜ðŸ˜
Gre >=305, verbal >=145 and quants >=160 means 30 hours course
Else 36 hours no matter what
Are the prerequisite courses included in those 36 hrs?
Nope
Pre requisites are not counted anywhere
But you have to take those courses in the 1st sem itself
How many of them?
That depends on how many you got
I have 1 pre requisite which I'll have to take in the 1st sem
Where will it be mentioned?
Admit mail
+1
Take toefl or Ielts again
Else you'll have to give English exam when you go to us
No courses are mentioned in my admit mail
I took ielts n got same score. So I m asking how to explain the situation to VO if I get this i20. Thr shud be ppl in uta who got in with this. Please help me out
In your physical letter
Same for me ! No need of any prerequisites for us !
If nothing is written why are you worried buddy?
@918105323088
Even in my physical letter it isn't mentioned
I had thought everyone will have prerequisite courses
So just wanted to know
Oh coolðŸ¤˜ðŸ»
Thank you
Hi guys. Can someone with pre requisites please show how it is mentioned in their physical letter ?
A snap of it will be very helpful
Yeah there are 3 mandatory core courses that we need to take these are not not pre requisite courses
These core courses need to be taken by all of us depending on the availability in the each Sem
Name the courses please
Will they allow zipped folder into VAC ?
They allow
Okay thank you
ðŸ˜ƒ
Try to bring a folder which has lots of compartment
It will be useful
For arranging diff set of documents

Not so. From India to us
Wherever u go in us

Thats it

Next steps after getting visa?

Get ut International driving license.. sit back, relax and board ur flight âœŒðŸ¼
How long did it take for you to get it??
How did u pay??
How to apply for international driving licence?
In an international driving school... Duh ðŸ˜›ðŸ™ˆ
Even I am checking the same
Shhhhhh
International license is useless
Come here. Give a test of 6 hours online . Go to DPS and get learning.
After that apply for DL
What's the $$$?
Ok, thanks for the suggestion Rudy
Oh thanks Rudy.. but how much does it cost?
If you are >25 then no need of online test also
Fantastic
Test of 6 hours??
Just online
At the end of each section there is a question section
OkðŸ™„
35$
Is this a learning school??
It's Not a learning school.
It's like RTO in India?
See online course is around 6 hours. In that course, they teach about driving rules. So after you complete it, you get a certificate. You have to take that certificate, i20 and lease documents, and credit card docs if you have which specify your address here in US. Then they will do the processing and send you a learners permit. After that you can drive provided a person with a driving license is besides you.   Within 6 months of learning licence, you need to apply for Driving License Test. There you need to drive the car, do parallel parking and other stuff. If you clear it, you get DL(driving Licence)  The entire process takes a month.
If I need driving classes What's that process..how much will it cost ðŸ˜”
International permit is valid for 6 months only. So it's actually useless. Even I had got it. But seriously it's not worth a effort
Driving classes kyu bhai? India mein nahi chalata kya?
Thanks
Left hand driving ðŸ˜•
Idhar easy hai bohot. Sirf left mein chalana hai. GTA khel aur practice kar
Arrey kuch nahi. India se toh easy hai
My frnd in upitt told that its fine if we drive on indian Licence in his state. Is this same for Texas ??

Non CS background guys do not worry

From what seniors have told, it can be waived if: 1. You have taken that subject in your undergrad, just show the grad advisor your transcripts, *or* 2. You can talk to the grad advisor and take an exam which if you clear it will be waived off
Guys, correct me if I'm wrong though :p

You can register your forex card there and pay directly from that
SBI
This I got from our 2016 CS group
34% fees we pay complete value right ?
That's great news , thanks
UTA gives three options for paying fees: 1) Pay 100% fees at a time 2)Pay 3 installments: 34, 33 and 33 all at intervals of a month 3)Enrollment loan where first you have to pay 40$ to enroll into the plan and then after a month pay 50% and 50% after another month

So including other fees it will come around 10k
Depends on number of subjects you take

Ok, on the conversation about reply from Rodrigo
I had his reply right after I have submitted the pdf along with my queries
What was his reply ?
He said he had forwarded them to Sha'londa in his reply mail but no reply there after
So I mailed him again yesterday
I also got a very similar reply
He then replied back to send those questions again
I have sent them again yesterday..
Her reply will b thisðŸ™ˆ
I had sent a total of 5 queries actually
Hope she replies to atleast one of them ðŸ˜…
These were my queries:
1. I am a non-thesis student with GRE Quant 161 and Verbal 144, with a total of 305.Â Will I still be eligible to take 30-hour course?  2. If I have to take the 36-hour course, the admit decision mail I have receivedÂ has mentioned about two deficiency courses. Will these 36 hours include the deficiency courses or they are to be fulfilled separately?!  3. Also, in the attachment you have forwarded, deficiency courses exams were mentionedÂ on 23rd August schedule. Is it like these exams would determine whether the student must take the two deficiency courses in the first semester or not?  4. I have 3 years of work experience as a software developer in a Top 2nd IT CompanyÂ in India, which is Infosys. Below are my complete score details of GRE and IELTS. Based on these, could you let me know what are the credits needed to qualify for the summerinternship after completing 1 year of the Master's course?  GRE: 161 Quant, 144 Verbal, AWA: 4.0  IELTS: 7.5  5. Based on my short profile above, will I be eligible to apply for a Technical assistantshipafter the first semester? If not, will I be at least eligible after the first year of the course?
Do let us know her response ðŸ‘ðŸ»
Yeah, sure ðŸ‘ðŸ»
For 2nd question you will have to do 36 hours course + 2 deficiency courses. Your deficiency course will not be included in your 36 hour credit.   For 3rd question the test will determine if you need to take those courses or you are good to go. Means you don't need to take those deficiency course if you perform well in test.

Take the bull by his head then


Bro
Invest into the MS with a mindset of completing it.
Else its just waste of fund.


I would still suggest you look up for another sponsor.

Get a new sponsor.
And start a with a fresh mindset.


Once you reach there look for opportunities, it's called the land of opportunities for a reason. ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡ðŸ˜‡


And don't get boggled down by my harsh comments, sometimes it's better to get harsh words then funny chats.


ðŸ¤œðŸ» bro fist to you


Can't say for sure

Any reviews about centennial court apartments?
They are very good but expensive
Rooms are small.
What are the cheapest options available off and on campus... Approx??
+1


For paying loan money??
Cost per each course is 3K
First sem fee will come around 10.5K for 3 subjects
U can pay fee all at once or in 3 installments
If u want to pay fee bit late, u need to pay 40$ and deadline gets extended
You can see final fee amount only after you enroll in courses
Anyone done with visa interview today?
Yes

Hey*
I have mailed Rodrigo about it and he said he had included my name as one of the students who will be joining this Fall and he confirmed that he sent a bulk mail to all of us which included my name as well
To know more, mail him asking if he had included your name in the list too
Ditto
In some other UTA group, I heard that UTA doesn't accept the insurance we would take from here.. better take the Univ and we can pay the insurance too in installments it seems

hey can anyone help me to register for CSE advising group?
Ignore
Visa approved.. Here is my experience.    Date: 30th June 2017  Consulate location: Mumbai  Slot: 10:30 AM  Â   I reached consulate at 9:45 AM. Was waiting in queue outside the US Consulate, to go inside. It was 10:30 AM and still I was outside.   After sometime the queue moved ahead and now I got entry in consulate from the very first door. Security checking wad done after this gate and then we were sitting on chairs inside in an open area.   After certain interval they were leaving us to go inside the interview hall. Here now I can see and listen the ongoing interview. Itâ€™s like railway ticket window. There is a volunteer who assigns the counter when you reach to him. They verified the finger prints and then my turn came and was assigned counter 25. I went and stood before the Yellow line. This line is you can say buffer line. Volunteer keeps the interviewee ready before the VO is done with the ongoing interview.  Standing on this line you can clearly hear the other interviews.  VO was drilling down a guy for 20 mins. approx. and seeing this I got too much worried for my interview.   The VO was around 30 years old.  Here how it started interview.   VO: Signaled me to come ahead.  ME: Hello Officer.  VO: Ignoring my greetings said "Pass me your Passport".  ME: You just need passport. Don't you need I20?  VO: Oh yeah, (with small smile) pass me your I20 as well.  ME: Passed the I20 and Passport to him only. (Kept the SAVIS fee confirmation page with me on the counter)  He kept my passport and I20 aside and went inside somewhere empty hand. I was just thinking where he has gone. But was not feeling any nervousness now. Was confident and normal.  He came back within few seconds.  VO: typing... typing... typing... Ok. When did you......?  ME: Sorry. You arenâ€™t audible. Can you be a little louder and near to the mic please?  VO: Going near to the Mic. Asked â€œWhen did you do your bachelors?"  ME: I completed it in 2013 batch.  VO: Batch...?  ME: Yes, 2013 batch.  VO: Okay. What were you doing since then?  ME: I joined a startup company name as XXX in Nov. 2013 but then company shifted to other location so I left it in July 2015 and joined "Travelex - Worldwide money" in October 2015 and since then I am working here.  VO: Okay, So how many universities you applied to?  ME: 5  VO: How many admits?  ME: 2  VO: Ok. So, why this university?  ME: Due to multiple reasons:  First: Research: Many research in AI, NLP and ML are in progress like "AI in mobile and Social media", which are my area of interest. This will give me advantage to explore and learn more.  Then Second: Professors experience. Uni. provides experienced professors like XXX having experience of 35 years.  Third: Professors rating: The professors of my field are rated more.  Forth: Student to professor ratio is 19:1  Fifth: University ranking... (Here he stopped me)  VO: Seems like you have done your homework and done lot research on this uni. Good.  ME: hmmâ€¦ Just gave a small smile.  VO: You have mentioned that your parents are sponsoring you. So what does your parents do?  ME: Officer my Dad is a Production Manager Head in Film Industry.  VO: Sorry Where?  ME: In Film Industry. In a low and audible tone I said â€œWhat more should I say.â€  VO: Thatâ€™s Coolâ€¦ Do you have any loan?  ME: Yes Officer.  VO: Of what amount?  ME: 30L  VO: typing... typing... typing... puts my passport in the small bucket beside him and said Golden words. "Your VISA is approved. Have pleasant stay in US". You will be notified by a message and email when it's ready to collect.  ME: Thank you officer and left the counter with all the rest of the documents.   Note: Actually when you are saying truth you get the confidence by itself. You need to give a kick start. Just be normal and only answer what VO asks. I feel that was key point here.   And for anything else ping me anytime if any help I could assist with.

Is this true that CPT in UTA is allowed only for those having unconditional admits??
I think the only requirement is that one needs to complete 18credits to be eligible for cpt
Yes, and people with conditional admits usually find it difficult to complete 18 credits before summer. As they also have additional subjects to take care of (which does not count)
True... But if we cover up by opting for 4 courses and fulfill the requirement of 18 credits and 3.5 gpa... Then would it be allowed? Any credible example u hv heard of?
Will have to ask seniors who had conditional admits.
Looking for roommate and place to live  Any suggestions?

ðŸ˜¬
ðŸ‘ðŸ¼
Mail them
Won't it be best to carry the money in forex card and make the payment ?
I think its best that we land there and then top it up (its a huge amt)...otherwise carrying so many bags and imp documents ...with it tution fees leke jana one more added tension
Forex card or credit card is the best option.
Forex ... dont take ur indian credit or debit

For sponsor details bank passbook are enough or need to get the bank statements as well ?
Take last 6 months bank statement of your sponsor
Replace Passbook with balance certificate
Thanks for the link ðŸ‘ðŸ»
Any specific reason?
My Visa officer specifically asked for my sponsor's passbook
Yup I m taking the passbook
Did your sponsor have surge of money in his account?
I did the transfer atleast 45-50 days back
U maintained the balance after it?
Let Aditya Answer.
ðŸ‘€
The account was being maintained for decades and no sudden huge amount of cash was dumped into it at any time. So there was no problem. The Visa just looked at it for around 10 seconds and gave it back to me.
*Visa officer
Can't be the case with the gentleman who has surged money 40-50 days back.
ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
This is why I was suggesting to carry statement over Passbook
If he has a definite genuine answer for it, (like sister's marriage, cancellation of FDs, maturity of life insurance premium, Company bonus etc.), then he will be fine .... It all depends on how we explain to the Visa officer
He need to provide evidence for the same.
Guys any idea about forex card
Which one to take
Axis bank is best I heard
I've heard that SBI has lowest conversion rate
SBI
Does sbi works?
Forex?
Yes

Visa experience  Mumbai consulate  Time - 09:00 am Date - 5th July UTA University   Reached consulate at 8:30 . Entered the waiting area inside the consulate at 8:55. Waited till 10:05 then our row was sent inside for the main interview where identity was confirmed through biometric scan.  There was long queue before me approax 80-100 people and also Raju hIrani ( munna bhai's director- standing in the line like lukhaðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚)  Counter no 36 was the best VO (full jolly person )  I saw and prayed for him ðŸ˜‚ and the god listened ðŸ˜Š  Vo - Good morning sir  me - Good afternoon sir ( with  smile,)  Vo - pass me your passport and I 20.  ME - Sure sir (passed ).  Vo- so why you are going to uta ?  Me-  Sir, uta is highly known for its research activities even the Carnegie Foundation has ranked uta as the R1 university meaning university with  "highest research activity". The budget of research expenditure last year was 45 million dollars  of which 5 million dollars were used by computer science department itself . (I stopped,  it seemed like he was interested to hear more )  So I said " Because of these reasons I want to study at uta   Vo- so u want to do research? (Showing interest) Me- yes sir .   Vo- very nice, did u give gre?  Me - yes sir.  Vo- how much did u score ?  Me - 307   Vo - what is Ur previous degree ? And when did u complete ? Me -(I stumbled little for these answer ) I completed bachelors in electronics and telecommunication from Rgit,versova - mumbai in year 2014?   Vo- pardon, which year ? Me - 2014 sir.  Vo - ohhh , what did you do for 3years?  Me - sir I did job for 2 years at KLB INSTRUMENTS AND later with DEGSON.  Vo- hmm OK OK . Who is sponsoring you ? Me- sir, My father is sponsoringâ€‹ me.

Me - thank you  very much sir  ðŸ˜ðŸ˜ I was leaving  Vo - hey listen study hard in us n do some good research .....( With friendly smile ) Me - yes sir I will for sure  thankyou sir .  Note - be confident and be yourself. Always be happy while answering and welcome new questions with smile. Be cautious Vo might stare u, expecting u to answer more but be calm and answer only how much u have prepared (short ) because more u answer the more questions he will ask you ( I deducted this while standing in queue )   Also, I was nervous as hell in waiting area. So , I calmed myself by talking to people randomly. It worked like a charm for me.   All the best to all
Study Hard good advice ðŸ˜
Nice answers ðŸ™‚
ðŸ˜ðŸ˜
Bhai tum logo ki dua h ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰
Nice and congratulations
How would u justify choosing this university known for research if you're admitted for non-thesis?
Thanks bro ðŸ˜‰
Vo doesn't know what we have chosen
Thesis or non-thesis
Its written on f1
Congrats @919022781623
It's mentioned in the i20 and admission letter right
Yes. I20
Ohh I forgot
My visa was a month agoðŸ˜…
I would have told ki sir I applied for the thesis option but  got the admit in non thesis  ..  But it is mentioned on the website the courses can be changed at the beginning by talking to your graduate advisor and my senior friend currently studying at the same university confirmed the same
Oh okay, thank you.
Anytime ðŸ˜›

Guys is there any way I can get extra baggage allowance by booking flight from third party websites like goibibo, mmt n apps ?
I don't think so ...which airlines?
Guys...one question.. While travelling with BA.. we would have a layover at Heathrow...so we just have to transfer our cabin baggage..and the checkin baggage they would shift it to the other flight ...m i rite?
Yes .... I called British Airways and asked this ....
Guys anyone knows the exact amount of fees to be paid and what's the deadline for it?
Not yet finalised looking at the options
I booked 3rd baggage separately cost me 3.5k in Qatar

Deadline is 21st august or something
And the amount we'll get to know after we choose the subjects right? Thanks! :D

Changing date for international orientation costs  *$20*. ðŸ˜ This is not mentioned in mail or not even notified that we will be charged while changing .  It's mentioned somewhere on their website but.
It is mentioned on the website
Ya I got charged too!!
To which date did you change
14th
Guys 13th augest , qatar.
Who is coming?
From where?
How is Santa Clara University for MS in CS ?
British Airways, August 12th at 1.45 am from Mumbai anyone ?
It's very expensive I heard!
How much ?
Santa Clara is a very good university...expensive yes...  But u will have a name associated with you for the rest of you life. Not to forget, living will also be on the expensive side.
Guys for how much amount would you be taking the travel cards for?
and how much time do the banks take to issue a travel card?
I didn't get the name associated point
How am I supposed to be ashamed of a name called santa clara
Nagpur to Doha to dallas
Neither failure nor success has the power to change your inner state of Being... Keep smiling... Be happy.
14th is not for international graduate students
What ? ..ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥ðŸ˜¥
It's for both international and transfer students
I think
Nope..I asked one of the advisor!! I also thought the same and has booked 14th
So what did he say ?
But then I confirmed it and had to change it to 17th
Yeah.. I confirmed it..sorry bhai..I know the feeling! May be you can check once again
And u have to pay reschedule extra $20?
You need to change it
So I changed it to 17th
Yeah
Thanks for the info.
Ohh even I changed the date and got charged 20$
Is this amount reflecting in ur mymav?? When i tried to check my account, it shows nothing under tution / fees
Whats the average cost of living in texas? Per month.
400-500
I guess this amount is including the rent
Yes
Anyone who has got loan from pnb?
Yes
They are telling me this univ doesn't feature in top 200?
So they can't offer.
Were you told the same?
ðŸ˜³... What??
Nope
Did they ask for collateral?
These national bankers are assholes. Literally
Loan got approved
Okay.
Yeah
Hahaha ..could be ..i have good experience while dealing with them
You must be knowing someone in the branch. I know people in Hdfc. But credila's interest rate is so high
If any any University falls in their top 200 list they offer 8.5% interest rate otherwise it's 9.something ..
Nothing about not approving the loan
So you got 9? Or 8.5?
9 since uta is not in that list
Yeah my mom was in pnb
Yeah but this bitch is telling me they'll need confirmation even before applying.
Congo buddy !!!!
Which bank ?
Thanks man..
Pnb
Guys who are yet to book flights a info - BA Also provides student offer but they do not provide it as extraâ€‹ baggage instead they provide it as 7% discount .... If u r booking  BA then use that  ba.com/studentoffer
Anyone travelling by British Airways on 15th aug from Mumbai??ðŸ˜…


British airways 17 hrs stop  Do i need a transit visa?
Yes
But it depends on timings
On arrival?
Please mention the timings
Entire night
Then you'll require a transit visa
Can i get it upon arrival?
I don't think so
Call the British Airways and confirm with them
Okay ty
But as far as I know, you will require Transit Visa
And one more thing  With transit visa can i go outside of the airport?
Why do people need a transit visa?
Basically for people who have more than a certain hours of layover?
If your departing flight leaves the on next date, you'll require a transit visa .... Or if you want to go out of the airport, then also you require a transit visa ....
Accha. Okay!
There are 2 types of UK transit visa .... Direct airside visa and Visitor in Transit Visa .... Only with Visitor in Transit Visa, you can go out of the airport
Congratulations Arpit ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽŠðŸŽ‰
Bhai I land at LHR AT 6:50AM AND DEPART FROM SAME TERMINAL AT 11:55 AM ON THE SAME DAY I.E 5HR LAYOVER  WILL I ALSO NEED TRANSIT VISA ?

There are many groups of uta and some more students will be added to the count apart from common people in other groups
Woo that's cool then ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»

What would be the total number of Indians doing  MS course in UT Arlington ??
Vigneash sundar

How is UMBC CS ?
Nice .... You can go for it
It's very good.. @918898952848 can answer for this ðŸ˜Š
R u being sarcastic ?
UMBC CS is better than UTA CS
No she's serious
+1
NoðŸ™„
And how much GRE score is required ?
I have around 62% in Pune University
305+
Few projects and internships
Acads doesn't matter for umbc
Infact more than 300 wud be a safe bet for u
Why didn't u guys go for UMBC ?
ðŸ˜…
Got a reject ðŸ˜’ else I wud have opted for umbc
Reason for rejection ?
Low gre..   PS: Don't ask the score please ðŸ˜›ðŸ™ˆ
Okay
But I am afraid about my undergrad @919503308316
I can tell u for umbc it's not a problem.. One of my frnd had high Acads 66% from PU but got reject coz of low gre
Ohh
Tell her score atleast
So I can set a benchmark
ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜…
Told u bfr 300+ is a good score.. Try to score more than 305
66% is not high Acads
And also for UMBC, 305+ is a recommended if not must
okay ðŸ‘ðŸ»
Dude for Pune University it's high!
ðŸ˜…ðŸ±
True Mumbai and Pune university boards are poor people wen they are asked for giving marks
ðŸ˜‚
Sometimes toh u might be getting 70 0f 75, but u will get KT
Punekars and Mumbaikars know the painðŸ˜¬
True. And the good part is the universities in US know about this.
How is that

Little relief for us
Aapbeeti (personal experience)
Suny Binghamton CS vs UTA cs.
Guys anyone who have got vaccinated recently?
22 under ?
Uta cs
Uta ranks 72 according to usnews
Acc to us news ranking.. Uta ranks better.. But don't trust the rankings
Yaa , any other things my friend should consider
Dude ranking hardly matters , where ever we go it's just us studying
I agree with java.
Me
Which vaccine?

Take print out from UTA Meningitis page and got to doctor
He will tell you
Meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MCV4)    Meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine (MPSV4)  One of the above vaccines should be taken by people whoses age is less than 22
Okay thanks I'm 21

Around 14 to 16 days back

Thank you ðŸ˜Š will there be prerequisite exam for both these courses?
Yes
Thank u !! Couldn't find this in the internet !!
Guys!! CSE2315 is very easy. Invest your time in studying for deficiency exam. Main advantage is you will save $3000
If we have to take prerequisites do we have to pay 3000$ for each subject
Thanks a ton yaar!ðŸ™ŒðŸ»
Yes. You have to pay fees for regular course even if you are enrolling in deficiency courses
Its ~3200 dollars
Bro anything for CSE 3320 N CSE 2320
No..
ðŸ˜”
Google karo na... ðŸ˜›
Bro is there any exam for cse 3320 ?
To waive these deficiency courses, you should either clear the waiver exam or you should have already taken these courses in your undergraduate and you should have it on your transcript
If you have on your transcript, graduate advisor will waive it for you during departmental orientation
No idea..
I have three deficiencies 2315, 3315, and 3320 !! I can write exam for only two in that !!! All i am asking is if i clear 2 of those and have to attend the third one !! Should i pay 3000 extra ?
Pls karke do na
ðŸ˜…
Will do tomorrow.. ðŸ˜‰
Thanks youðŸ˜
Guys, anyone travelling thru BA on 9th August 7.15 AM flight from Hyderabad?!
Anytime buddy...
If there is no deficiency exam or you have not taken the course in undergraduate or you cannot clear the deficiency exam, you have to enroll into the course and pay 3000 for that course
Each course 3k$???
Yes

Guys, will FSI or Big howdy pick up for 7:25 PM arriving students?!
I think yes

During ur departmental orientation, u will be able to select subjects and waive off any pre requisite if possible
Waiving off the prerequisites will happen if you clear the exams which will be on 22nd or 23rd ....
+1
I  had two pre requisites, but I had already completed those subjects in my undergrad, so I waited it off by showing transcript... If u haven't completed that sub in ur undergrad then u need to clear the exam for that
I didn't have operating systems in my undergrad and it is there in among prerequisites !! But there isn't any exam for it !! So what are the options ?
No opt.. U have to take it in sem one
Yeah u need to take that course in sem one or two, whenever it's available

Yes

I 20, Passport and visa compulsory required. Other than that carry admit letter and precipitation for any medicine you are carrying. Keep all the documents in hand bag or carry-on bag. Don't put in check-in bag by mistake. Keep documents handy.
ðŸ‘ thxâ˜º
I have 60% in Pune University 1 internship Few projects and social work
What should be my GRE score for univs like  SJSU SE CSULB SE UMBC CS
please help ðŸ™ðŸ»ðŸ™ðŸ»
Me
305+ is recommended .... Try to score 310+ ....
Can any1 give me the details of designated school official details for UTArlington??
Arrin hines i think...as given in the i20
Oohh shuld we say the person who is mentioned in i20??
For yout interview?
I think so...
No interview..for port of entry in U.S
Can we keep the copy of i20..or shld we need the original i20 itself
Original
Original of everything. And keep a receipt of any forex you are carryinf
Oh ok ok thank u
I dnt hve receipt of forex..
Usually they dont ask for it but better to carry it if you have it.
Oohh kk
And prescription for meds if you are taking any
ðŸ‘
What do u mean by receipt of forex?
Any idea about wat all they will ask at port of entry??
They'll ask you to show your passport and I-20. Keep other documents too like SEVIS fee receipt, Admit letter, etc. They'll ask basic questions like which university ?, How long do you expect to stay on USA ?, Will you work off campus ? etc etc
20hrs per week is the limit for on campus right??
Yes
ThxðŸ‘ anything else that i shuld keep in mind for port of entry??
It's just like a (mini) visa interview
So then do i need to keep my property info for financial documents proof??
Not needed
But don't take it lightly or talk to the port Officer rudely .... He has the power to cancel your visa and send your back
Like affidavit and all?m
They will ask proof of address of usa place of residence...
Keep a Xerox copy of your documents
Ya that i am aware of..so nly asking details of port of entry..
Ya..for that can i take a print out of the apartment details from the website or anything else??
Proof that you have accepted you lease and all that...
Do we really need address proof of usa !!
?
My lease transfer is not over stil..
Can't we just say that I'm going to stay in Temporary accommodation in Arlington Hall and after a week, I'll finalize an apartment ????
+1
Apartment is not my name !!!! Main kya karoon ?
Co-lease mein mera naam hona chahiye kya ?
In that case, tell him what I told before about temporary accommodation in Arlington hall .... Or else he'll think that you'll live illegally ....
ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±
Why?
They maintain strict protocols with port of entry and the address mentioned in ds 160 .... so be very careful
But that doesnt mean one cant stay at cousins place for a few days before moving in to the residence hall/apartment...
I agree!
There is seriously no problem. Just tell him any address confidently
Lol so was i ... just pulling his leg ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£

After our 'department' orientation, somewhere around 18/19 August I guess
Something like that

I don't think so ðŸ™„ I think it's before our class starts. Sum1 correct me if I'm wrong
Our CS departmental orientation is on 22nd August
SOmetime before 24th august. Exact date I forgot...
Correct
Should we register fr that separately??
Or is the mail that we sent to rodrigo enough?
Nope
That's enough

Has anyone applied for transit visa for UK?
You don't need it
You don't need a UK transit visa if you have a valid USA visa.
Only if you want to go out of the airport or your flight leaves on the next date, you'll need a UK transit visa.
Yes my flight has 14 hour layover in London
Does your next flight leaves on the next date ?
If it's on next day
You may require it
Yes it leaves on next day
Then you need a direct airside transit visa
Any idea how long it takes to get that visa?
Just call the airline and confirm!
Okay
Guys that optional orientation.  How do you register for it ? It says username password invalid
It's showing invalid password for many people including me since yesterday night.

If you are interested in networking you have to take networking but you also have to take computational algebra (supposing its a breadth course)
If you have young children, give them help, guidance, and protection to the best of your ability, but even more important, give them space -- space to be themselves..  Keep smiling...be happy.

How was immigration what did they ask
Immigration was long. There were like 200people and 3 officers. They didnt ask anything while stamping the passport. Then i went to collect bags. Then while exiting they asked if i am carry seeds meats plants soil guns drugs or not and if i am carrying any cash! Thats it
Can we put any non important electronics like headphones camera etc in check in bag.
Yep
Even external hard disk is fine right ?
I think so. Though i had all of the above in my hand baggae
Is staying on campus is better? Then off campus?

I have a transit at JFK and then to DFW.. Should I go through immigration and security check at port of entry ? JFK ? Or shall I just transit to DFW ?
You have to go through port of entry process at JFK .... Also you need to Checkout your bags for customs check ....
Fuck !ðŸ˜£
This takes up a lot of time .. nd i have a similar case with only 1hr 40 mins layover.. how to manage that?
Same here
You have to explain to the people in line in front of you about your situation and ask them to let you go ahead of them .... And if it's a big International airport like JFK, San Francisco etc, you're screwed .... Otherwise, you can manage
Really no other alternative ?
Anyone who's been through a similar experience?
You have layover where?

Guys, me and my friends couldn't make it today on time to the Swift Center and we dint get our documents verified or whatever. So the thing is we have our orientation tomorrow, will it be a problem ?  We can attend the orientation, right ?
Seniors ?
Yes
I dont think it will be a problem.
Ppl do it b4 hand so that they don't have to stand in line during orientation
Same here i couldnt do today asked seniors they told we can do tomorrow
Just need to be in a long cue
Long queue for wat?? Wat shuld be done b4 Orientation guyz??
For document verification
They told nothing to worry
Just will have to stand in line only that stuff
Go to swift centre, show them your passport and I 20. Get a small receipt that says documents verified. And then go to nedderman hall for orientation
Kk thx for the infoâ˜º
But 8 am is our orientation will swift centre be open at that time!!!
Yes, it starts at 8am
Thanks!!
Well that is why it is advised to do it beforehand
It opens at 8 am
Gm da
What's the location, where will the orientation be 2moro? ðŸ¤”
But one of the guide said to me that we can get it done on the same day of the orientation from 7 am onwands in nedderman hall before the orientation
We need not go to swift center for doc verification
Is Bluebonnet Ballroom same as nedderman hall
??
Nope
Then orientation location is Bluebonnet Ballroom!!!
So document check can be done there
Blubonnet is in university center

Don't worry..I guess u can finish it till November
Did anyone of you register for the TB screening for a particular date. I remember doing it somewhere and after registration it said that it will be added to fees etc. But I am not able to find it now
It needs to be done to remove holds

How long is the process for opening bank account?
In chase or wells Fargo bank
Half an hour in wells fargo
What are the requirements?
I20
And passport
I20 and passport
How about Chase?
Has anyone opened an account with them?!
Not yet
Shall we go all together
For chase
M taking my roommate to chase today for account opening
ðŸ‘†
Wells Fargo have conditions
Yes, even i want to open am account in chase.
We can go together
How to book appointment
I got my account at Chase.
What is the procedure for chase?
Chase will also have conditions if u not between 18-25
Just take ur i20 n pp
Chase or Wells Fargo which is better?
No appointment needed. I walked in and asked for student checking account. They asked for my passport and i20.
Took me 20-25 mins
Used my forex card to transfer money into the account.
If ur in the age of 18-25 then go for chase
Guide us yaar..ðŸ˜¬
No conditions
When will they deliver credit and debit card?
But i found wells fargo to be faster is processing
Got my netbanking working at the beach itself. The card will be delivered in 3-4 working days.
My other roommate has chase n i have fargo
In*
Tell which is better
This is for Chase or wells Fargo sidharth?!
Netbanking n Phone banking starts instantly in chase as well
Any benefits that either one of them give?
Overall chase better
Chase
Wells Fargo have conditions lyk maintaining balance
Wow, where to reach out to them in university?!
+1
ðŸ˜ðŸ¤˜ðŸ»
Important : Chase mein forex se paise nikal k account mein dalne k liye only forex company WI charge not chase
Minimum amt?
Guys come to bookstore
Yes but fargo givs u debit card immediately which can be used anywhere and chase temporary card can only be used at atm
They have an office right in front of 404 border.
We ll go together for chase
But in wells Fargo, both bank n forex wale will. Charge
This can be waived off by swiping card 10 times even atm is counted
And online shopping
I used my card 10 times in 3 days
Anyways sabka apna apna choice hai, I am above 25 so I preferred chase
In the longer run, kisko yaad rahega re ki kitne baar swipe kiya?! ðŸ˜…
+1
U can login to Android app n see
How many swipes u have done
This was awesome info man, thank you!ðŸ˜ƒ
Extra dimag k liye tension. Hai to be b honest
So ur maintaining 1500 balance right ?
When is the next orientation?ðŸ˜…
We have to
Above 25 rule
Thts y i didn't opt for it
No
No 10 swipes ki jhanjat
I dont want to lock in so much amount
1500 is a lot ðŸ˜…
Its either 1500 or 10 swipes
Yeah that's what I said.. Apna apna choice ðŸ¤£ðŸ‘ðŸ»
What's the exact rule?!
I heard from a senior that you can get past that 10 swipes thing ders sm trick
I'll let you know once i find out details
Kul mela kay baat ye hai ki chase better hai?ðŸ˜…
18-25 no minimum balance required thts it
Cool, I am in safe zone ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜œ
ðŸ‘ŒðŸ»
Where is well fargo branch? And where is the chase branch? To open account?
What is the amount transfer charges from one acnt in Chase to another from bank at home
Wow, thank you ðŸ™ŒðŸ»
Group link please
Thanks a lot @918411000368
ðŸ˜Š
Np mate
ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‘ðŸ»
So I should opt for student acnt as I am 24ðŸ˜Ž
I heard there are more number of Wells Fargo atm on campus then chase?
Wells Fargo has also got similar kind of charges, for atm withdrawals from other atm n wire charges.. But wells Fargo has got ATMs inside campus, not chase.
And everywhere card works so. Cash rarely required. Even in parking machines you can swipe card.
Choose wisely and you are welcome to choose as per your choice. Cheers fellas
Same ðŸ˜ƒâœ‹ðŸ»
Thank you yaar ðŸ˜ƒ
N as per me, Chase ki baat he kuch alag hai... ðŸ˜…, unlike wells Fargo they don't do apne bank ka so much marketing.. Chase apna tushan mein rehta hai.. After all its JP Morgan Chase Bank..

Anyone bought laptop here
Which is better
Any student offers gng on?
Even i am looking for laptops.
I am looking for phones on contract.. anybody any idea??
Laptops you will get on student discount from the bookstore or best buy.
Phones you cannot buy on contract unless you have an ssn. So you have to buy an unlocked phone and get a prepaid sim.
Best buy
I got my phone and laptop from best buy
Which laptop
Dell inspiron
Oohh kk..
@919830419030
How much
For students we can get phones on contract  In At& T stores
You can give  it  a  shot  and see how  it  works
Was looking for something higher but i exceeded my budget on the phone so got the dell for 650$
Configuration pls
I checkes the at&t store....the only phones they have on contract are iphone se and 6s
Vch phone u got?? How much u paid??
Config of laptop
Any idea wats the monthly charges n all??..
Amd a12 2.5ghz processor. Ati r7 4gb 12gb ram 1tb hdd Full hd display Touch display
Any better one in Lenovo
Got s8 for 575$. It was on discount. Prepaid sims are like 30$-60$ depending on the plan.
Legion y520 but thats 1000$ðŸ˜…
I7 7th gen Geforce 1050 4gbs 16gb ram 256gb ssd
Do they hve international calling in that included??
International calling is like 15$ extra depending in the provider. I would recommend not getting international and get a higher data pack so you can call home using whatsapp skype viber hangout etc etc
Hhhmm ya.. ture..

Sure.. plz dnt forget.. coz i am also buying so need info..

Anyone here know how i can import .sql file into aws rds?
Google it bro ðŸ˜…
Reason for this?!
Oh. Nothing to do with UTA. just something i needed help on.
Duh.
Ohh , okies, .SQL file usually has Database code probably a query or stored procedure or function, you can view it with normal notepad or notepad++
And
Yes. That could be one way to go about it. Inefficient though. ðŸ˜”
Below seems to be efficient way to view .SQL in a amazon relational database
ðŸ‘‡ðŸ»
http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/SQLServer.Procedural.Importing.html
Take a backup of it as .bak and export it.. works for other RDS or try to replicate your database
I spent a good time looking into this. Couldn't do it before. Let me try it one more time.   This one also mentions the bak file and putting it in s3
Okies
Try and let me know
I can find any other refined process, but try this one once first..
You u want to just take the structure or both structure and data?
Both
RDS has a migration tool
Ok I have a mysql db. Not sql.
That doesn't work for mysql
Please Tell me more?
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/introducing-the-amazon-rds-migration-tool/
But this will replace both data and structure
Last time I check it didn't do only structure
Is this a paid service? ðŸ˜
Anyone who paid for overweight luggage in BA ?
Yes but then again unless u are an aws certified engg a clean migration is difficult
Also if you have a smaller db migration will be less than 1$
Not necessary
Direct likh pen se, scan using cam scanner and upload..
Hand written is good enough?
Yepp
I filled it too
One more doubt... my dad and mom holds a joint account.. so is it neccessary to put my mom as second sponsor becoz of joint account?
Nope
Not necessary
You are filling this to upload it to UTA financial documents upload page naa?
Yeaa
Haa
Not need of mentioning
No*

Wat abt u??
Hey guys  At the health services page we only need to fill the tb outreach form, right ? That is form H ?
Yeah
I filled that but there are other forms too. Do we need to fill those ?
I think we do
Reached
Just the TB outreach form
Don't worry. As far as i know, Health services has tb tests eveyday 19 th onwards. Just make sure u have appointment with them. This 15 and 18 is to make sure that people don't miss out on their dept orientation which happens to be much earlier than us CS guys.
How to schedule appointment ?
It says you're not eligible to schedule
U can call them to schedule an appointment

Where is today's TB test scheduled what doc's to carry there
MAC
TB test in Maverick Activties Center
From 10-2
Then independence day celebration
I don't have my id card yet do I have access to MAC
For tb test yes
Where's is this
Will go and find out
Its from 5 I think
Venue for the TB screening is Lone Star Auditorium
Where is that
It's MAC right ?
Ask at reception they'll guide you. Take a right from staircase
Yes
Yep
Thanks guys
Awesome thank you
Any one already there?? Is it like a Q
No
Auditorium, and it's filling up fast
ðŸ‘€ there are so many???
50+
Il probably reach at 1030 ðŸ˜›
So what documents I need to get with meet
Me
Passport and I20 should be enough I think
ANd we can go anytime I hope?
Until 2
They do
Just make sure you do online TB form, those who don't know go to TB package section in bit.ly/uta-tb
Is that actually required Priyank? Many ppl said u just need to walkin directly.. nothing else is required
U need to fill it here if u haven't filled it earlier
+1 swift center guys said the same yesterday Johnsy, that we can walk in and we don't need to fill the outreach packet..
It will save you some time if you fill it online..nothing else..you can do it here as well
Oh, ok
Because for those who havnt filled online they are giving up some card with instructions
This one
ðŸ˜‚
So better fill online and come
Yes
Do bring your pen and passport to avoid any problems
And 2/3 rd auditorium is filled.
Nice to see entire crowd at once
ðŸ˜
Student count ~300
True
Still pouring in
Im on my way too
How much time does TB screenin take?
Should we be coming after 11 or 12 so that the crowd is reduced
That could be a better idea
The speed is slow. I don't know if you could expect slim crowd
Anyways done with the TB screening
When do we get results
After 3 days, at ur UTA mil id

Is that same as we sign n sent him the scanned copy??
13th july thats when i received it...
Yes
I guess I need to open in front of someone, there must be some kind of thing missing here ( for now you can assume it's the mail which is missing.ðŸ˜…)
So then basicaly u have not sent the form back to rodrigo... and did not register for the dept orientation!
Department orientation, I haven't booked. International orientation I have registered for. I replied to the Rodriguez when I found the document shared on the group.
Good for you



Ping him today... ASAP
You Mean Rodriguez? Did you guys get any response from him?
Nothing apart from a thank you
just visit the hall even if u havnt registered. no worries
Okk
Thanks. Guys for the support
Go to him and talk directly if u are here
Ok. I think I should go and ask him.

Any idea where we can check classes schedule?
Guys, Wer can we collect student ID card from? I will be attending International Orientation on the 17th of Aug.
You'll get it in UC, opposite to Starbucks. But I doubt they'll give before orientation
What are health center requirements? Like I have hold of that
Is its just TB? If not what else?
Just tb
No basic blood report n all required?
If TB cleared, both holds regarding health center will go
Does anyone have hold of no domestic address found and one from international office?
I have still got 5 holds: 1. International office 2 health center follow up 3. Health center requirement 4. Academic dept 5. No valid fone on file  I undertuk the tb test today.  Wot shud I do for hold no 1,4,5?
International office hold will go after your orientation
Ok. Wot bout academic dept
And I have already updated my fone no in mymav... Wer else am I supposed to update in order to remove hold no 5?
After dept orientation..that goes as well
Same i have updated my address as well..it still shows my hold
I put it in the physical address yesterday, today that hold is gone
I guess we shud wait for a day more and then we must approach swift center guys.
N we get our Id's from university Center,
Also i am looking for accommodation... does anyone have vacancy for 1 girl?
For phone number. Select the option as 'current' instead of mobile or permanent.   That should immediately remove phone number hold
And for address?
Best is to check uta_apt and uta apt group on fb
Just posted there as well
I am not sure. May be a day? I don't remember my update
I just added a local address as physical address...i hope this should remove the hold
That page also requires UTA photo ID and sign to be uploaded...is that the page I r referring to Sarthak?
U*
Nope

Hi all
sup
Which sim card are you guys using
And the plan
I just arrived in DallasðŸ™‚
Lycamobile is good
at$t
It's provided by ICC
Plan details bro
35$ for 2 months..
1gb 4g data
Then unlimited 3g
Free calls to US and international
Free calls in USA and to India .... 1GB 4g data per month, after that unlimited 3G ....
2g
Mera ho gaya 4g khatam after that it's unlimited 2g
What abt Pakistan :-)
You may ask that question to any Pakistani seniors
He said international...
Bro is Pakistan included in it
Can you check ðŸ™‚
nah, dont think its free for pakistan
:-/
its cheap, says on its website
http://www.lycamobile.us/rates/pk/calls-to-pakistan
If I need to travel to Dallas N spend a day there N come back what's the cheapest transport available to me here
Train/bus i think
Uber takes 20$ per way
You can get a shared ride from people who are travelling ...
Or that
Thanks
Get one day pass at 2.5$ per head. Catch MAX bus. Bus will take you to centerport station. Catch train to Dallas union station it will drop you in downtown. And you can come back in same pass. Normal charge is 5$ for UTA students its 2.5 only. Carry 2.5 cash as in bus they don't give change back.
Thank you, kind Sir :')

+1
I've been told the same
5th Sept is deadline to enroll.. but once u enroll...deadline to pay is midnight on the day u enroll
Yes. I asked a lady from the authorities regarding this, she said the day you enroll for the classes, on the same day you will have to pay the fees. Till midnight
Do we have to pay extra for the chest x-ray or the insurance covers it as well ?
I heard the insurance covers it
The insurance doesn't cover the chest x-ray

Does forex card come under debit or credit card ? Yesterday while I was paying fee to centennial courts (online ) extra amount was cut
Debit card
Does extra charges apply for our semester fees too if we pay it online?
Yes
If you swipe your forex card, the charges will be least, I heard
Go and swipe it. It will consume time but extra fees won't be deducted
Lol nope
Swiping limit is 10,000 only it seems right
What about the remaining fee then
?
Apart from withdrawing money from other ATM forex card won't charge anything for Swipe's and online transaction
Even if u want to take money u can take for free by visiting chase Bank
Teller will be der she ll check ur passport n will swipe ur card n give money for free from ur forex card
Or u can transfer ur money from forex to ur chase account


Todays graduate orientation is optional right?
Yes

For students who have enrolled today what is the deadline to pay fee???
Although, you need to get the X-ray done and get the hold cleared by a followup date given.  Else, the classes would be dropped.

How can we take that then
Mine got waived
Hoe
So did mine
How?
ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
I showed him my transcript and said i have took SE1 in my undergrad and he said okay
Anyone with ds under jiah rao
Me
Me
Me
Do we have to take anything apart from idcard dor the exam right now?
Is there anyone who isn't taking a core course this semester? Is that allowed?
Who is taking software testing under Ali Sharifara
Me I think so
Me
How is he? Any idea
Anyone here taking Secure Programming under Levine?
No idea tbh
ðŸ‘†ðŸ»
I have secure programming under thomas
I wanted to but then it was waitlisted
Even I wanted to.. shalonda said it's for undergrad not for graduates..
But it starts with 5....  its for grad
Ya...system allowed me to enroll so it's valid
U have 30 credits or 36 credits hr
Because for 36 credits it becomes one of the mandatory course
Which is a mandatory course??
30 i guess
Se1, db1 and network1... 2 of any three
Oooh... then thats fine
I have took all of them in my undergrad
Me tooo
They r not mandatory courses.. they r called levelling courses
I think you should den go and talk to graduate advisor  Take your transcript or marksheet and a copy of your syllabus
I think this is correct
But can we get it waved off... and select any other course
Depends on the graduate advisor...
But its better to select 2 of them....because anyways it will be a prerequisite for next level courses
Yes in a way its good
Any update on DAMT
If they are opening more class for it
:(
Nah, don't think so. Specifically asked Dr. Sajeeb about this he said take something else instead.
Results of TB test (who took on 18th) are out ....
There are 21 people in the waitlist right now for 5301. I wish they form a new section.
guys any one paid the fees via forex card ?
Me
âœ‹ðŸ»
Me
Any one did via wire transfer
?
Wire transfer is allowed only through flywire, which is very expensive
It's not expensive
You have to pay only the currency conversion charges
Its only expensive if you pay via debit card
If you do NEFT or RTGS then its on par. Only Rs. 210 more when compared to HDFC forex
Axis Forex doesnt charge extra.
Yeap
ICICI also
Axis charges significantly more than the rate on Google...I loaded my card for 66.7 when the rate on internet was 64.something
I know that selling and purchasing rate is different but hdfc charged me only 50paise more
Yesterday when I checked HDFC was converting at Rs. 65.10 and Flywire was converting at Rs. 65.11
Its is charging me approximately 11k rs. More than the conversion rate.

Did any of u enrol for algo-jesus
Me

Identifying yourself with the body, you become the body. Then you are a mortal.  Then there is fear of death.  Non-identifying with the body, you are just a watcher, you are just a pure consciousness, a no-mind.  And there is no death and there is no disease and there is no old age.  As far as your witnessing is concerned, it is eternal and it is always fresh and young and the same... Keep smiling... be happy.

what was the rate of conversion they charged
any taxes or overhead?
Anyone in 3320 david levine class
Always welcome ðŸ‘ðŸ¼
â‚¹64.5 per 1$
Hain, forex top up karte samai to liya ab dubara charge kyu
I don't know for sure but it could be upto â‚¹250 extra
I am doing it via flywire
No no .... Dubara koi charge nahi laga .... That was the loading time charge
It'll charge you around â‚¹5000 more
according to the RTGS the rate of conversion is coming up as 64.9
how?
Jinta mymav me bataya utna hi laga naa ya phir aur kuch tax extra
No extra .... Only the amount which was in MyMav ....
Ok cool, tyðŸ˜Š
Actually, my SBI Forex card has $5000 daily spending limit .... So, I did it in 3 times .... $5000 + $5000 + $460 ....
I am requesting them to deposit 10549.19 $ -> INR 684819/- and that's all that is mentioned there, so how will they charge more?
They might charge upto â‚¹250 more ....
This is via Flywire
If u pay through forex u have to pay this much
If we pay via FlyWire, we are paying â‚¹10,000 extra
So, better to pay via forex card
Guys I'm planning to pay fees on installment plan , wch is best option to pay by forex or by chase debit card
Both are equally good ....

Depends on which forex card you have...if you hdfc then it's almost the same as flywire
Axis is costly
ðŸ˜³
I compared both at the same time. Only 2-5 paise difference in conversion rates for either of them.. flywire and hdfc forex I mean
Mine is SBI
I am sure they'll have the same
Ya
as flywire
Plus the restrictions of 5000 per day
Mine is axis
It's free
Not costly
Ty
Don't know then..they charged me almost 1.5 INR More than the online rate
Pay with forex, y again transferring to bank and paying... Better pay with forex
U don't go directly with bank
Reload through BookMyForex
They don't charge anything
Ohh is that so
Nice
Also they ll give discounts
And also 0.1% cash back
After 1 order

How to get this?
Anyone has cn-1 coursework by dr. Kashefi

Guys, after the bank pays the fees through flywire, do we have to show the flywire receipt in davis hall or somewhere to get your mymav updated that your fees are paid?!
No
It will automatically get updated
Ok ðŸ‘ðŸ» Thank you ðŸ˜ƒ
ðŸ¤”
Site for adding money to you Id card
guys where can we get the fees payment statement
?
Meaning, receipt from flywire ?!
Nope like after paying fees we get the account statement
stating everything they have charged for
So where is NH110 ??
Near Kalpana Chawla memorial
You can get it from your MyMav account
yes but PDF is not loading
not sure why
Go to student Centre and click on Account enquiry on the left .... And then click on charges due .... Then click on print account statement .... Then click on 2017 Fall .... Now you'll find the complete distribution statement of your charges due .... Hope this helps
Ya did bro PDF still not loading need to check in college thanks guys
Browser issue
I guess
Try it again with ur pop-up block off
PDF won't load automatically .... You have to print it as PDF yourself .... Try with Google Chrome v60 and check for any pop-up block ....
ok
Also, try once in your smartphone too .... If the issue still persists, contact the UTA Records Office ....
It takes ages to download the pdf ... Just wait for about 10 mins or so .. worked for me
ðŸ¤£ atleast it is loading for u
hehe
The download of pdf actually happens during loading ... When u press that download button it just saves locally the already downloaded file

With awareness there comes choice. And so you are able to say: 'I allow this moment to be as it is'. And then, suddenly, where before there was irritation, there is now a sense of aliveness and peace. And out of that comes right action...

Swap not allowed. Only you can drop and enroll into classes
What difference would this make?  Like that would be shown in my profile or in terms of fees?
swap may not involve fee payment, drop and enroll might I think..
Okay  So can I swap if there's an option to swap on mymav?
Swapping can be done by only grad advisors right, that's why we used to wait for hours infront of their offices.. ðŸ˜…
Nope.  We have this option on mymav.  I used that already ðŸ˜… But that was at Aug end.
not sure about the consequences of doing it using mymav then yaar, sorry.. ðŸ˜¬
No Problem
We received a mail from Sajib Datta that swaps not allowed
