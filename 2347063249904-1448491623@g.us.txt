I'm personally fulfilled reading this. I must share. ~A MUST READ, ESPECIALLY SS/SE, MAY YOU RECOVER YOUR SENSES.   Donald Ekpo replies Alhaji Sagir  RE: BIAFRA IS A PLOT BY IGBO TO COLONISE SOUTH SOUTH â€“ Alhaji Sagir Ringim  Sir, I want to thank you for your concern about the welfare of the people of the South South by exposing the plans of the Igbos to recolonize the region. But I am worried about the sincerity of these your concerns. Because of these worries, let us dissect and carefully assess your statements of fear and concerns in four (4) segments, so as not to repeat the mistakes of 1964, 1966 and 1967-1970s till date. In your carefully written letter or chat with the Journalists as reported in the national dallies yesterday, you clearly stated that the Igbos want to;  (1). SEIZE THE ECONOMIC PROSPECTS OF THE MINORITY ETHNIC NATIONALITY OF THE OIL RICH REGION.  Alhaji Ringim, may I remind you that the economic prospects of the South South is currently being seized and controlled by your people of the Northern protectorate of Nigeria. Does that in anyway mean that you agree that your people have colonized my region? Are you also aware that even the oil wells in Abia State, Imo State and Anambra state and recently Enugu State (Igbo land) is being owned by your people in the Northern Protectorate? Are you aware that we in the oil rich region (South South) do not have control over our wealth, and its fortunes are determined by your people? Are you also aware that after sharing the proceeds of oil between your protÃ©gÃ©s in Shell, Mobil, Agip and Chevron, the left over is given to 44 local government of your state Kano, and only 8 Local government of Bayelsa? How more criminal could that be?  Do you know that even when the Natural Gas from my State Akwa Ibom is used to generate power from my state owned Power Station, that the fraud of a constitution you fostered on my people does not allow me to use same electricity in my state or region, but I am forced to load it into the National grid that sends same power to your home in Kano State? Have you seen how the United Nigeria is enslaving me? Are you aware that the fraud of your constitution took away the economic prospects of my region by empowering only the Federal government to build roads that your people from the Northern protectorate never built in my state for over 40 years until the coming of our own Son Goodluck Jonathan, when he allowed state governments to tamper with Federal Roads, yet you were busy building all the so called federal roads in your region.  That your fraud of a constitution imposed on us by you and your allies in the southwest took away the power from us to develop on the economic prospects of the region thereby taking away our rights to economic progress for over 50 years. And here you are sir getting worried of what the Igbos will do to my people. Sir, have you been ever worried about what your people have done to my people? How many of my people have you killed in your region? Please tell me the number of my people slaughtered by the Igbos in their land that is enough for me to be weary of them. Remember that these are my neighbors that lived peacefully with us for centuries, shared cultures, intermarried and even celebrated common cultural events before you came with your successful propagandas that deceived our fathers?  (2). COLONISE THE SOUTH SOUTH, CAPTURE THE REGION, COLONISE THE OIL FIELD FOR BETTERMENT OF THE IGBOS.  Alhaji Sagir Ringim may I remind you that the Igbos are not the colonist as you have insinuated here, but you and your people in the northern protectorate. They have so far not shown the threat to colonize as when compared to your people. It is your people that used the oil from our region to better the livelihood of your people and that of your few allies in the Southwest. It is you that is synonymous with the word â€œCAPTUREâ€. It is your people that kill non-indigenes in your region to take-over their property. Alhaji Sagir Ringim, just in case you think this generation is as vulnerable are our grandfathers and fathers you deceived by your propaganda. You were able to make them see the Igbos as their enemies in the 60s. Please note that this is the 21st century of 2016.  We are aware of these same lies you told our grandfathers and fathers in the early 60s. We are aware that after lying to them that they were different from the Igbos, you still went ahead and killed them in the name of killing the Igbos. We are aware of the devilish, malicious and infernal act you used one of your willing protÃ©gÃ©s General Gowon to do when you suddenly created the South East State (Todayâ€™s Cross River/Akwa Ibom State), Rivers State (Todayâ€™s Rivers and Bayelsa state) just to devise the divide-and-rule policy that was advise by the evil British woman just to break the unity of the region.  We know that is was also based on Awolowoâ€™s advise that certain parts of Igbo were sliced off, and added into the new states you created so as to weaken any form of unity that could hold. We have also read from a list of newspaper publications from the New York Post of the 60s as compiled by the LOWER NIGER CONGRESS on all the atrocities you committed against the people of the region before your final propaganda to separate them by these hypocritical lies. And we promise you that even though you used your fraud of a constitution to discourage the study of Nigerian History of the said period in Nigerian Schools, we will do well to expose this events in a carefully Chronicled format for every child/youth of this generation to know the truth. How dare you assume that even in the retard state of your protectorate, that you can conveniently influence the minds of the learned region in this millennium?  (3). BIAFRA IS LANDLOCKED AND WASNâ€™T BLESSED WITH SOLID MATERIALS APART FROM COAL, ADDED THAT THE GEOLOGY OF THE ENCLAVE CANâ€™T SUPPORT AN INDEPENDENT COUNTRY.  Alhaji Sagir Ringim, if these are your fears about the existence of Biafra, first of all, are you revealing the fears of your region, the Northern protectorate of the 12 Sharia states or the entire protectorate? You do not have any mineral resources and you are landlocked. Are you telling me you and your people have been so worried of surviving alone hence your insistence of a non-functional ONE NIGERIA PROJECT? Let me explain this to you Sir;  The Igbos you are taking about do not just have a large reservoir of Coal in Enugu that can last for another century knowing that Coal is presently running major economies in Europe, South America and South Africa, the region also has a large reserve of Oil and gas in Abia and Imo state. Oil exploration in Anambra state has also commence and will soon commence in Enugu State. Can you see that your propagandas wonâ€™t work as it did in the 60s?  Apart from the fact that your people maliciously separated the Igbos from their original race to Delta, Rivers and Akwa Ibom states, we at the LOWER NIGER CONGRESS have taken it upon ourselves to expose the malicious schemes of lies you used to separate our region. Your protÃ©gÃ© General Buhari made it easier for us on National Television when his hatred for the people overwhelmed his ability to continue in the cover of your propaganda. He acknowledged the fact that we were all the same people. That notwithstanding, in a matter time, your lies and propaganda will hit the broken bridges of discontinuity. How dare you generate fears that do not exist for your selfish interest? You must have been thinking how successful your deceitful and hypocritical lies would go in rejuvenating the lies of the 60s.  (4). BECAUSE OF THESE NATURAL SHORTCOMINGS, IGBOS SURVIVED AS A DIASPORA RACE THAN ANY DOMINANT GROUP IN NIGERIA. THE ECONOMIC PROWESS OF THE IGBOS IS DOMICILED OUTSIDE BIAFRA.  Alhaji Sagir Ringim, this is the most absurd and ridiculous of all your concerns as expressed by your expression of love towards my people in the Niger Delta region. Industrialist do not just sit and lazy about as expected by you. And these were one of the fears and concerned expressed by your late Sultan in a video we managed to see where he was worried about the Igbos in the north. Alhaji, are you aware that your successful brother, Dangote; one of the richest man in Africa, has his economic wealth spread and domiciled outside the Northern region? Or are you in anyway saying that because people expand, explore greener areas, that means such an individual has no space in his home? Your points are a bit too ridiculous to have considered as your reasons for granting this interview.  Having segmented your major reasons for advising my region to be weary of our Igbo brothers as those that intend to recolonize my people, I stand bold to say that you and your kinsmen are guilty of all your worries. It is also a cause for concern that you and your allies have suddenly decided to worry about the Niger Delta region. When did you love the region this much?  1. Are you not the same people that classify us all as Igbos during your killing and butchering spree and largess in the north?  2. How come you are bothered that the people you classify as one when butchering, are two different people when it comes to owners of wealth?  3. If you could desecrate our land as if we do not exist, come in and take away our oil wells as though it belongs to you?  4. Announce on National Television that the Oil in Bayelsa belongs to you in Kano and Jagawa?  5. Kill us at will if your religion is disrespected in faraway Norway?  6. Determine for us when and how our roads are built and how we use power generated from our resources?  7. Swore over your graves that our our kinsman cannot be President or else you make the country ungovernable of which you did?  Yet you have the guts to tell us to be weary of those that have not in any way attempted to take anything from us by force. I truly hope you realize that this is 2016 and not 1964.  It is best to inform you and all those that have decided to cry more than the bereaved that we are aware that these are the same propaganda you used to separate us, then forced us to continue in this unholy Union. That was a very unfortunate thing to have happened that kept us in this bondage.  Fortunately for us, the UNITED NATION CHARTER ON THE RIGHTS OF THE INDIGENOUS PEOPLE is a tool you cannot do anything about. THE LOWER NIGER CONGRESS has taken advantage of these rights and it is set to call for a referendum. Quit crying on our behalf, we are presently studying the Constitution of which the Region will be built upon and so far, it can never be an evil as the Forced Marriage called Nigeria.  Thank you for your concerns Alhaji and co."  By Donald Ekpo  PLEASE LET IT GO VIRAL BY SHARING HERE & WHATSAPP PAGE.

*_A girl missed her period 2 months ago,her mom took her to the clinic for pregnancy test of which it was positive.Embarrased, her mom said; who is the pig that got you pregnant?

I can't marry for now because of my family issue, but I promise I will take care of her for the rest of her life, and if she gives birth to a girl,I promised to buy her a mansion, 2 jeeps and 1 million dollars. If it's a boy, I'll buy her houses in a country side, 5 jeeps, 2 big factories and 5million dollars in her account. If it's twins, I'll do anything she asked. But if there's miscarriage, what do you suggest i do?

Assuming after dancing and rejoicing in your new mansion yesternight, you woke up this morning to rush and catch up with your daily activities as you are doing right now, and  you saw your body still lying helplessly on the bed. You were shocked, You tried to pick up your iphone 6 to call your (Rev) pastor or relatives and you couldn't pick it up. You tried opening your wardrobe to pick some money you hid there and couldn't.  You started crying but no one heard you. You try touching the gate to go out, but u just went right through it. You went outside and your house mates were chatting, but you were not recognised. After some minutes, you saw your house neighbours coming out of your room with a severe cry, hitting their hands on your brand new Range Rover Jeep.  All you could hear them saying is *"HE IS GONE"*  or *"SHE IS GONE"* You stood there watching them cry their hearts out in pain. So you asked yourself *WHERE EXACTLY AM I GOING?* Your spirit started crying bitterly, because you were not prepared to start that journey so soon. BRETHREN where exactly do you think you are going if you stop breathing right now?. *Are you aware of your final destination?* Remember your creator now because we have a place to go. So start preparing. Share to a group. I choose the WhatsApp to prompt you of eternity and the only Lord and Saviour- *JESUS CHRIST.*HE alone can take you home (HEAVEN).

I have a problem with the church and I want to address here. Too many pastors and Christians alike are lazy! We hear something from another preacher, without finding out from the Bible to be sure its true, we then take it up and also preach it.  Due to this, some churches have even developed their doctrines based on lies. Some examples of these lies yet common in the church are as follows: 1. That Jesus was born *in the manger*. 2. That *God helps those who help themselves*. 3. That *when u commit sin, you cannot take communion.* And that *when u take communion without confessing your sins, you shall be curse.*  I wonder which part of the Bible this is located. I've been very quiet about these unfortunate ear irritating lies but now that I have realized its also the same in Nigeria and not Ghana alone, I've decided to start a campaign against lies against the Bible.  1. Luke 2:12,16 says *"Jesus was laid in the manger* not *~born in the manger~*. *Manger* is a box in which animal feed is put in for animals to feed.  The only difference between *Man* and *animals* at creation is *the glory of God upon us*. But when Adam and Eve sinned, *Man* became *equal with animals* because *the glory had departed*. Baby Jesus laid in the manger *is the Bread of life* for *the animal-like man* to eat *and gain the glory back!* Plz from now, no one should ever say ~Jesus was born in the manger~.  2. That *God helps those who help themselves* is not true. This quote is a saying of a  former American president. *It is nowhere in the Bible.* In fact, this statement is even not true. It contradicts *grace* 100%. If God helps those who help themselves, then it means that man will share glory with God (which can't be). Grace is *Non of you, all of God.*  3. That *when u commit sin, you cannot take communion.* And that *when u take communion without confessing your sins, you shall be curse.*  Well, the devil has done well because he used this to use Christians and pastors very well and to deny many people of their blessings, miracles and healing.  1)Â Â Â Â Â It is notÂ the Lordâ€™s Supper you eat, *for when you are eating, some of you go ahead with your own private suppers.Â As a result,Â one person remains hungry and another gets drunk.Â Â Donâ€™t you haveÂ homes to eat and drink in?*  2)Â Â Â Â  So then, *whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord inÂ an unworthyÂ mannerÂ will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord.*  3)Â Â Â Â  For those who eat and drinkÂ  *without discerning the body of Christ eat and drink judgment on themselves.*  4)Â Â Â Â  So then, my brothers and sisters, when you gather to eat, youÂ should all eat together.Â Anyone who is hungryÂ should eat something at home,Â so that when you meet together it may not result in judgment.  Do you see it now?  It is the way that they ate which is unworthy NOT THAT THEY WERE UNWORTHY. This is because the people were treating the Lordâ€™s supper as it is a private supper! Some came and ate everything. Hence there were those who were hungry. Some came and drank everything. Hence people were drunk!  They were not leaving enough bread and wine for other people. So the solution Paul embraced was that you should EAT TOGETHER!!!  Paul also reminded them that they need to discern the body of the Lord.  The bread is broken for you so that you will be whole. The wine is the blood that has cleansed your sins once and for all. So when Paul asks you to â€œexamine yourselfâ€ this is what it really means:  _â€œCommunion is not a time for self-examination but Jesus-examination! The only thing that will empower you to overcome sin is the grace of God and itâ€™s not stored in your navel. Look to Jesus! His blood bought your forgiveness and His death triumphed over all your sin. See yourself crucified with Him (Ga 2:20). Reckon yourself dead to sin and alive to Christ (Rm 6:11). He is our perfect high priest, a Lamb without blemish or defect. Donâ€™t draw back but come boldly to the throne of grace for Christ Himself qualifies you._ - Paul Ellis  _*Pastor Dr. Emmanuel E.

Do you love fruits and vegetables?  Do you have  land lying fallow with no idea of what to do with it? Do you love to farm but do not know how to go about it?  Do you love to farm but have no land?  Are you  already into farming  but you are not satisfied with the yield?  Do you desire to  have highyielding stems, tubers, and fruits?. Do you desire those special  breed of animals for farming?  If you answer yes to any of the questions above ,  then you need to join the MG GREAT AGAIN Revolution. You may need to make a quick decision because the rain â˜” is here farming has already begun.

There is 5m withdrawal limit on individual accounts(reason is as above, to avoid crashing banks)   3. There is withdrawal limit of 10m on corporate  accounts (reason as above)   MMM = CBN  MMM as a  CBN  to regulate activities of members imposed restrictive withdrawal limit on the amount for the same reason with the CBN (to avoid crashing, to avoid emptying the entire deposit...

ðŸ‘‰What is the Ideology of MMM?  MMM is not a business or an investment. MMM is an idealist revolution. MMM is a socialist movement to fight against the unjust world banking system who exploit you, who use your hard-earned money to get richer & richer but render you poor & poorer! MMM is a socialist fight over capitalism. Capitalism creates unfair & unjust class struggle in the society but Socialism strives to create an equal class or what Karl Marx referd to as 'Classless society' & Sir Sergy Mavrodi's ideology for a classless society is the MMM platform!   ðŸ‘‰How Does MMM Works?  MMM is a mutual Aide community of pple Giving & Getting Help globally. Participants willingnly decide to provide help to members who need help. On providing help to a member in the comunity the system rewards you with 30% of ur 'donation' (not investment) to the comunity. You are also rewarded with Registeration bonus, referral bonus, testimonial video bonus & other bonuses. NB: Nobody forces u to invite or refer any1 to MMM, every donation/PH you give attracts 30% mavro/money growth in 30 days time. Inviting pple is ur social responsibilty/contribution to the MMM comunity; and you are also rewarded/paid 10% for every help ur downline provides to the comunity.   Note there are no Central MMM bank account where all the monies flow through to members. Help Providing/PH & helping getting/GH are done directly to members' individual bank accounts.  ðŸ‘‰What are the Threats/ to MMM?  The key threat affecting the MMM ideology is *Panic* & *Greed*. Avoid them!  Play within the MMM Rules.   ðŸ‘‰What are the Rules & Regulations of MMM?    *Dont pledge what you cannot fulfill * Dont Pledge/PH all ur savings- PH on ur spare money *Avoid fake POP (you'll be parmanently deleted frm the system * Dont Create multiple accounts (you'll be blocked) * Confirm all payments received in ur PO on time   Finally, remember the sustainbility of the system solely depends on her members, to *continually PH, be honest & avoid panics!*   Together We Change the World!

â˜€Duta Quote of the Dayâ˜€  Move your focus from competition to CONTRIBUTION ... Life becomes a Celebration! Never defeat people...Just win them! ðŸ‘  . Have a winning day ahead ! ðŸ™‚  #copied
ðŸ‘
Can u throw little light on winning & defeating pple?
*Winning and Defeating people: two parallel working principle.*  A winner does not take the "won" as a loser, he embraces the "won", encourages and shears values able to make the "won" better of.  But in the game of "Defeat", the victorious warrior tries everything possible to continuously subject the "conquered" to perpetual slavery (read history about the empires, especially the Babylonian empire). Conqueror hardly sees anything good in the conquered. He's an authoritarian also.   A winner looks back to the tactics used by the loser and tries to pick up those ones he never knew, works on it, matures it, employs it and never forgetting to always mention the source of it when he finally succeeds with such tactics.  The world will be better of if we complete and complement ourselves and not to compete.   Competition is dangerous if it becomes the driver of any business or ambition.  A man that labours to undo him that's at the top will never get to the top, why?  Because he destroyed the ladder to the top!!!
ðŸ‘ðŸ¾
But does this negate the reality that you must hv competitors in business?  Does this rule out the fact that the Enterprenuer must knw his competitors or else his competitors will 'conquer' him? Can we go further in life without striving to 'conquer' or 'win' our competitors?

To All Real Mavrodians  At least spend some minutes to read this....  Once you have any amount of money in our community MMM, It means you are a stakeholder in MMM Nigeria community....I am very sure and I stand to be proof wrong, that all stakeholder's of an organization will always look for the success of such organization and do everything possible to make sure that the organization succeed and stand firm.  It's so disheartening when most of you talk like SATANIC AGENTS......Most of you talk against MMM like as if you have not enjoy the platform before.......or as if it is a wrong thing to do UPGRADE for better performance....  All of you that just rush to GH because your enemies are telling you things against MMM or you hear evil words from your enemies that never want you to be free from bondage, you must know it now that it is not possible for MMM to match all of you one day, MMM will not do that at all, infact MMM is against such activities where everyone GH one day and expect matching one day, that can never work in MMM because it pose danger to the community. Some of you that call yourselves PARTICIPANT, UPLINE, GUIDERS that do not even know MMM ideology I pity you....You claim you are a PARTICIPANT, UPLINE, GUIDERS and you also go back and talk against MMM, all these is because you do not know what MMM stand for...  MMM is not a BANK.....MMM is not a MINTING & PRINTING company for money....  MMM is a donation organization where everyone help each other to achieve personal need per time....  You should take time and click the link below and read it clearly and understand more on what we are doing in MMM...  https://www.nigeria-mmm.net/legality/  MMM is in more than 118 countries of the world and MMM will keep developing in more countries....If you do not know what to say about MMM......You should keep mute because no sane person will pray for a loss where he or she put their money.....If you are such person, then I put it to you, that you are really SICKED and suffering from PSYCHOSIS and you need a psychiatrist....  Stop listening to words from failure, failures want you to be down with them as they are always under, they want to drag you down so that you can suffer with them as they are always suffering begging for arms from January to December always hard time for failures...  Real Mavrodians are not failures because we help ourselves....  Matching is going smoothly and MMM is spacing the matching so that we do not do same DAY GH....same DAY PH.....MMM is wiser than you.  Mr. & Mrs. complainers....Your plans were not successful against MMM, you result in complains......Forgetting those months you were PHing & GHing and no one hear a word from you but now you keep complaining while the people that understand the IDEOLOGY keep doing their PH & GH....  True Mavrodians do not complain because they knew end is always happiness....True Mavrodian keep helping yourselves....  I am sure the PH & GH attached in this post are not payment for GHOST OR SPIRIT....If you agree...why then kill your soul with complain.....Take my word.....They're billions of PH uncompleted match order in the system and the money you PH now is also yours....PH as much as you have the money available to redeem...  Together We Change The World...
*100% mavro introduced by MMM!* Pls login ur PO
MMM Nigeria Introduces Mavro-100%  From now on, MMM Nigeria offers Mavro-100% to all the members for providing help both through bank and bitcoin. Mavro-100% implies that the amount of Mavros doubles in a month. The contribution of 10,000 naira will grow up to 20,000 naira in one month.  Mavro-100% grows daily and does not get frozen. It means Mavro-100% can be withdrawn immediately after its confirmation. The higher growth rate became possible due to the implementation of weekly maximums for withdrawal. Using this mechanism, the System always can balance PH and GH volumes and operate sustainably for unlimited period of time. Now a participant canâ€™t ask to get help again earlier than 7 days after the previous successful GH-request has been created. When a member creates GH-request, he can see the exact amount which is available for withdrawal in the current week â€“ this is his personalised maximum. The total amount of Mavro remains unchanged. The remaining balance is available for withdrawal in the coming weeks. This algorithm is beneficial for loyal participants.  Thanks to the combination of these three innovations: Mavro-100% instead of Mavro-30%, weekly maximums for withdrawal, and the promo-tasks contests â€“ MMM Nigeria will be more sustainable and will grow faster than earlier. Everything is just getting started!  By our efforts, MMM Nigeria will overcome!  We are changing the world!  P.S. We want to express our gratitude to the Community members who kept calm and showed loyalty during this transition period. Donâ€™t forget MMM values and ideas, use your spare money and believe in the cause of MMM!  P.P.S. After the end of the promo on August 5, the release rate of â€˜Mavro-2016-Contributionsâ€™ has been returned from 20% to 10% of the amount of your own contribution.

*MORE ANALYSIS OF THE NEW 100% MAVRO INTEREST AND THE RECENT UPGRADES DONE ON THE SYSTEM.*   Must readðŸ‘‡  The recent upgrade has come with so many assumptions and so many panic with people not getting it clear with the whole situation.   ðŸ¤·â€â™‚First we where told an upgrade will be carried out on the system and PH and GH will be paused, then we saw the introduction of *4times weekly GH.* as the first implementation   ðŸ¤·â€â™‚Secondly, we were told that *promo contest* will be introduced being d second implementation and prices will be won. Then also just as we were yet to digest that, we were introduced to 20% mavro defrost of 2016 mavro with d exemption of referal bonus which happened within a week   ðŸ’ªðŸ½  After all that, the complains kept coming of how GH and PH weren't  matched and as  result of that  comes in with  panic.  Then to avoid much panic programmers slightly resumed dispatching to calm some nerves.  ðŸ’ªðŸ½Still this wasn't enough,  we were told to have more patience as work is being carried out to implement the final phase.   ðŸ’ªðŸ½While we were waiting, *BOOM*ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¥ ðŸ‘ðŸ‘?*?came in *100%. Mavro increase in 30 days* as against the former 30%   While some will think of this as a ploy to lure many to PH, I wouldn't dispute the fact that It's a good one and be rest assured that it's not going to backfire and its going to be more member,balance n sustainability to d system.  Here's why, ðŸ¤·â€â™‚  ðŸ’ªðŸ½During guiders school, we were taught that MMM has the capacity to give out 100% but was not going to do it so as to make the system sustainable,but because we now have a new introduction in the system of weekly GH that will help cushion the effect of pressure in the  system,the 100% was introduced.   Some will say that's how twinkas made away with our money by introducing 100%,   But I  can tell you  while it cant  worked for twinkas for long time is due to the reason belowðŸ‘‡  *They are copy cat who lack knowledge about peer to peer*  *They are criminal n greedy*  *Lack of intelligent programmer like MMM*  *They have no founder unlike MMM that has a known founder ,a mathematician and intelligent programmer*  *They only exist in a single country Nigeria unlike MMM that exist in over 118 countries in the world*  And if with the analysis above, you still don't believe MMM, ask yourselfðŸ¤·â€â™‚ where is MMM and where is twinkas today, am sure its very clear to you now that MMM mean well and mean business for Nigeria  No copy cat can be compare with MMM, never.   Where were they  before Dec 2016 when MMM was really doing it for Nigerians for the  first time  They emerged in its absence  and  died again in the presence of the great and most trusted platform  after Dec 2016, to tell you MMM is the sure bet.   *BENEFIT OF 100%*  âœ´1.Bringing stability n sustainability to the system.  âœ´2.Prevent participants against copy cat that triggered lot of loss for people last year/this year.  âœ´3.Instant mavro withdrawal immediately after confirmation.  âœ´4.weekly GH to sustain d 100%.  âœ´5.Daily growth of mavro.  âœ´6.Increase number of participants on MMM   âœ´7. Maintain PH vs GH balance in the system.  âœ´8.Total removal of panic from the system.  âœ´ 9. Provision of good and enjoyable life for its participant.  âœ´ 10.No more December break.  ðŸ’ªðŸ½While we are celebrating this news, let's be aware that work is still going on in the site.   We still have unmatched PH and GH in the system and Programmers are actively on them   As for unmatched GH, let's expect huge matching any moment from this week  From me to you, I say, LONG LIVE MMM .  Long life Mavrodians.
I don't know if it is that we can't read or we didn't understand what was said or what?  Dispatcher has already been activated and *Will only match the GHes when there's balance between PH and GH*   We were initially given the opportunity to GH our 2016 mavro from the PH of our DLs to encourage us to register new people and increase the PH in the community but instead we started create fake multiple accounts, now they stopped it.  This time around they made it 20% with your PH to also encourage PH and enable us bounce back after the upgrade but we ignored it waiting for our GH to be matched (of which I don't know where the PH will come from).  Now again the monthly reward was pushed up to 100% this time around targeted at encouraging more registrations and increase in PH no matter how small knowing fully well that we can't GH the 100% all at once which will sustain the system unlike when it is full GH but we are not looking at it from that point of view rather we are seeing it as a deceit.  The question now is *"what do you want the System to do"* and *"where do you what the System to get the PH to match all pending GH"*???  There is currently imbalance between PH and GH and it is only through our efforts that we will overcome and right now the System can only overcome if we want to.
Please pass this information across to your friends Below is the email and text message my sister received from some frudulentÂ  Nigerian/kidnappers at about 5am this morning. These people claimed to be working for N-Power (The Federal Government of Nigeria Youth Empowerment Program)  Â Â Â Â  "Congratulations you have been succesful in qualifying for the Npower VAIDS program. Candidates are to meet on Tues 15 August  at Conoil Filling station, beside gwagalada park, area 1, abuja. Free transport will be made available from here to the venue at 12pm, 12.30 or 1pm. Further details sent via email"  Pls call your family members to be very careful. I called N-Power to be told that these people are scammers. I was told the email does not originate from them. Please post this High Alert Message on your Facebook, Instagram, twitter and (other social mediam means). Together, we can save lives of many Nigerians that will innocently or ignorantly fall into the trap of these evil and coward scammers and kidnappers. Please do not ignore; save a life today.

*Attention Wealth members. To be frank with you if you really want your Gh to be matched kindly follow this New Rule it's a top secret that was revealed..  1.

*A construction supervisor from the 16th floor of a building was calling a worker on the ground floor.* But because of the noise, the worker did not hear his Call.  To draw the attention of the worker, the supervisor threw a $50 note in front of the worker. The worker picked up the note, kept it in his pocket and continued to work.  Again to draw the attention of d worker, the supervisor threw $100 note and the worker this time quickly picked it and kept it in his pocket.  Now the supervisor picked a small stone and threw it at the worker.  The stone hit the worker. This time the worker looked up and the supervisor was now able to communicate with him.  Now think for a second... God wants to communicate with us, but we are too busy doing our worldly jobs.   Then, He gives us small gifts and big gifts... We just keep them... We keep on enjoying the gifts without thanking Him. At most, we just say: We are LUCKY.   But, when we are hit with a small stone which, we call PROBLEM(S), then we remember God.   That's when we look up to pray and communicate with Him. God gives, gives and forgives and we get, get and forget. Let's change our attitude.  So, don't wait for stones to be thrown before you know what to do or expected of you. Always, always and always remember God.   Make it a point to always say "God I thank You!!!" Sending this message to others will be beneficial to them.  Thanks and God bless.

true talk
Crypto trading is the next bomb on internet
So MMM has failed?
Don't be afraid of trading when it comes to crypto. Probability to loose is very low
No, participants failed
But I think they are working in MMM?
Participant did not fail. Mr Andrew fuck up
After d break last year December, many from mmm migrated to ghw. Ghw had her own issue around March this year and they were able to rectify it within 7days with Ghwx. This made alot of people to trust and praise ghwx more than any scheme. Even after mmm was fully back, people still stick to Ghwx and invest in mmm with little money.  When Ghwx: the most trusted finally fall July this year, it affects all other Ponzi in Nigeria. People that pH on mmm and other scheme were complaining that dere money were stock in Ghwx
Any proof?
Yes when the system was working fine. They came with upgrade, which made participate to cancel there ph
What happen how did it fail? And again Ghwx how many country can we fine this?
So you bliv the upgrade stuff? Lol The Truth is there are few pH in the system. So d delay was to get more pH which dey didn't
Ur question has nothing to do with d present issue. Ghwx is only in Nigeria mmm is in diff countries, but u can only participate in that of ur country. So u re limited to mmm Nigeria
Guy is now weekly gh no more once in a month and some other things that they implemented. So why doing this a lot cancelled there ph. Well I still don't believe mmm has failed the people that are failing us here is Mr Andrew and his crew. Well I rest my case hoping that things will fall back normal
Good luck
I ask u two questions and u left the first one to answer the other. I just wanted to kW what happen.
U don't need much knowledge about trading. Some of the things you need are coin market cap, exchange plateform
If you need help I'm available
Crypto trading is dependable
The admins scammed participants
What are u trading with Bitcoin?
Gush. So the system has closed?
Wow, u still have a long way to go,  We have hundreds of crypto, though btc is d mother of them all  U trade btc with other altcoin
Gone to glory
People are serious making payment when ever they are matched because they don't want to lose their 2016 macro,  but for them to come up to say not enough pH in mmm again hmmmmm, let it not be what we are thinking.
My dear when they start with this there upgrade, people cancel there ph that is one thing u have to kw
I don't wanna bliv u guys are new to crypto
I ask u question u don't answer me with question, I have a lot of things I do that u don't know like wise u. Not telling me I have a long way to go without u answering my question
So you will ph wen u av not received d formal one
D truth is that guiders eat alot
ðŸ‘†ðŸ¿ I've answered your question U don't read d last line  U trade diff coin with one another
If u don't want to say how it works forget it. I trade I do some other things if you want us to know about crypto go ahead and say it I once have account bf u since middle last year but I den follow it up. I even went to one seminar around garrison in ph which I paid with my 6k then
Ok
I have account bf just don't understand it
I have account I don't know if I can remember anything again. Is being long
Lol Not those type trade Those are Ponzi in disguise. Any platform that depends mainly on affiliate to pay participants na ponzi
What we do in crypto trading is ...... U invest in a coin when it goes down/low and sell when it goes up/rise or u exchange it with another low coin
U need d help of coinmarketcap to view d rise and fall of crypto
There is one seminar I went that time they said is 1-9-90 they still dail with crypto currency
1-9-90 as how
I have account but I don't know how it work. Do u kW it?
Let chat

Pardon??

Who put that on girls is really crazy
Lol
That's how we roll now....
So we must learn how to invest our money
ðŸ‘ðŸ‘ðŸ˜…
It's funny  But that's the best way to have a bright future
Moreover that's on gals not on a wife
Would you prefer investing or lavishing more of your money on ur wife or on profit ventures?
Women like money, fashion, luxuries, etc and all these things has no end, so why not invest first, den when u re rich like Amaechi, Wike, or maybe Dangote, den u can start investing on ur wife
But for gal friends, no investment at all
http://kryptomachine.com/?i=43510
ðŸ‘
Then u must learn how to stay without girls
Must money be involved? Can't  you have a girlfriend without spending money on her? If yes, it simply means that : there is no love! Because she is with you so i could spend on her or she claims to love you because u re spending money on her! We have to change this mentality
Then can't u stay with Ur wife without spending on her if yes it means she doesn't love u. Look every woman need little care if u claim u love her. For me is vice versa as a matter of fact man has never spend for me am hardworking. But I wish I can have that luck like my fellow ladies am always the boss when it comes to spending in a relationship. I which I can step down a bit. Conclusion take care of Ur partner if u have is not a bad. U save u spend life goes on.
I fit apply?? ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
So u re a female
Don't  know
I need cash and outing like mad!!! ðŸ˜œðŸ˜œ
Funny you
Anyway, any body can do the spending but i hate it when girls see the guys as the spending machine
ðŸ˜†ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜€
I knw the gurls here will hate u for thisðŸ˜…
But u are right.
But that's just d fact
On the contrary! No girl has ever spent a dime on me and i have been spending, lavishing money on the girls that comes my way,  at a time i became tired and fed up and its really hurting the ones around me now. They now call me '' Stingy boy'', i will answer : Yes baby!

The word "Eden" is an Hebrew word for "where God dwells", so the first thing God gave man was "His Presence".  (1)So the first thing a man needs is NOT a woman; it is the presence of God, and a woman should meet him in the presence of God. Eve met Adam in Eden.  (2)The next thing God gave man after putting him in the Garden was WORK. (Gen. 2:15). God gave man work before giving him a woman. That means a man needs a job before he gets a woman. God's priorities are very clear.  (3)The third thing God told man was "Cultivate"...... Cultivate here means, bring out the best in everything around you, to maximize the potentials of everything and everyone around you; to make everything fruitful. He only said that to the male. That's why God will never give a man a finished woman. The male was created by God to create whatever he wants. The woman you are looking for doesn't exist; she's in your head. Your job is to take the raw material you married and cultivate her into the woman in your head. So you have been married for 20yrs and you still don't like the product you get, that's your fault. (3a)If your wife is putting a little weight and you don't like that, don't criticize her; it's your job to wake her at 6am, " Hey baby, let's go jogging". (3b)You don't like her dress? Take her to a boutique and buy her clothes you like. (3c) She can't speak good English? Send her to school and pay her tuition fee. CULTIVATE HER!!!!  (4)The fourth thing God said to man was, "Guard the Garden". The man has to be the protector of everything under his care. That's why God gave you a stronger bone frame. A bigger muscle mass, not to abuse the woman, but to protect the woman.  (5)The last thing God gave man was his Word... God told man not to touch the tree; God never told the woman about the tree, NEVER!!!..... Which means it was the man WHO received the word of God and his job was to teach his wife the word of God.  NOTE: Nothing frustrates a woman like when she asks her man "So what do you think" and the dummy answers "what ever you think is OK"....or keeps quiet. ..Giving Silence...mmmm. Don't do that bro, don't do that. She's looking for knowledge and direction. That was the last command God gave to man in Vs 17. â˜…Now watch this: in verse 18, God said, "It is not good for this man to be alone". Now, don't just read the statement fast, read it again slowly, " it is not good for THIS MAN to be alone". WHAT MAN??? Answer : The man who is: *In his presence *Has a job (working) *Can Cultivate you *Can protect you *Can teach you. So here's the problem:  â˜… if you meet a man who doesn't like God's presence, isn't working, can't cultivate you, can't protect you and can't teach you, then..... IT IS GOOD FOR THAT MAN TO BE ALONE! *Full Stop!*  Please pass this across the Youth, married and your loved ones.  http://www.pridesibiya.com/2017/04/myles-munroe-relationships-and-marriage.html?m=1

To whom brain is given sense is expected
If you marry the right person, everyday is Valentine's Day.   Marry the wrong person, everyday is Martyrs Day.   Marry a lazy person, everyday is Labour Day.   Marry a rich person everyday is New Year's Day  Marry an immature person, everyday would seem like Children's Day.   Marry a cheat or liar, everyday will become April Fool's Day.   And if you don't get married, everyday is Independance Day!  Marriage is the only school where you get the Certificate before you start.   It's also a school where you will never graduate.  It's a school without a break or a free period.  It's a school where no one is allowed to drop out.  It's a school you will have to attend every day of your life.  It's a school where there is no sick leave or holidays.  It's a school founded by God:  1.On the foundation of love.  2.The walls are made out of trust.  3.The door made out of acceptance.  4.The windows made out of understanding  5.The furniture made out of blessings  6.The roof made out of faith.  Be reminded that you are just a student not the principal.  God is the only Principal.  Even in times of storms, don't be unwise and run outside.  Keep in mind that, this school is the safest place to be.  Never go to sleep before completing your assignments for the day.  Never forget the C-word...Communicate.  Communicate with your classmate and with the Principal.   If you find out something in your classmate (spouse) that you do not appreciate,  Remember your classmate is also just a student not a graduate,   God is not finished with him/her yet.   So take it as a challenge and work on it together.  Do not forget to study the Holy Book (the main textbook of this school).  Start each day with a sacred assembly and end it the same way.  Sometimes you will feel like not attending classes, yet you have to.  When tempted to quit find courage and continue.  Some tests and exams may be tough but remember,   the Principal knows how much you can bear and yet  it's a school better than any other.  It's one of the best schools on earth;  joy, peace and happiness accompany each lesson of the day.  Different subjects are offered in this school, yet love is the major subject.  After all the years of theorizing about it, now you have a chance to practice it.  To be loved is a good thing, but to love is the greatest privilege of them all.  Marriage is a place of love, so love your spouse.  More grace from God.   Send this to all your married friends to encourage them,  and to your unmarried friends to counsel and educate them.
To whom sense is expected, rightly use of it makes more sense Next time if you can't control your emotions in public, go home and insult your FATHER! Rubbish!
Please, it hasn't gotten to this! Lets be polite, rational and civilized in our speeches

How to Increase Google Adsense Earnings http://www.gideonike.com/2017/09/how-to-increase-google-adsense-earnings.html?m=1

24 SELF DEVELOPMENT TIPSðŸŽ“  1. Make friends with successful people and occasionally buy them gifts and surprise them with lunch because successful people always give and hardly get, so when you give them, they value the gift a lot.  2. Get a mentor and follow his instructions and respect the relationship. Never beg your mentor for money or disrespect his or her privacy.  3. Make new positive friends as often as possible and ensure you keep the communication line open. Create a network of friends and not just connections.  5. Show kindness to everyone. Some small boys today will be big boys tomorrow. The biggest dog in the neighbourhood was once a puppy. Keep the information/secret to yourself.  6. Always plan ahead and be proactive. He that plans the future works less in the future.  7. Listen to speeches and messages from great teachers, both religious and educational.  8. Attend seminars and trainings on any area you need to improve yourself - Train the trainer, personal development, public speaking, sales etc.  9. Have the habit of keeping a pen and a writing pad handy because ideas come in the form of flashes. The smallest pen is bigger and better than the biggest brain.  10. Make sure at every point in time you are reading a book. If you spend 20 minutes reading daily, for 52 weeks you would have consumed 1,000,000 words.  11.Stay away from television as much as possible. You can watch educational channels. Men with big TV sit in front of them to watch men with big libraries.   12 Put control over your mouth; never say evil of any man; what you are not certain of should not be said. Say good of all men.  13. Always show appreciation for any good deed you received.  14. Always help someone in need.  15. Live a debt free life. What you canâ€™t pay cash for is not your size.  16. Give out loans that you can part with as gift, so that you donâ€™t destroy your business and relationship.  17. Create legitimate multiple sources of income.  18. Save at least 10 percent of your income.  19. Invest a portion of your income, and be patient to see it grow. If what you have in your hands is not good to be called a harvest then itâ€™s a seed; sow it.  20. Keep a good financial record of all income and expenses, so you wonâ€™t ask later â€œwhere did my money goâ€  21. Be involved in community service- Control traffic, free lesson class for students etc.  22. Keep getting better on your daily goals and dream, develop yourself on them and make sure you get to the top 10 % of your industry.  23. Make sure you engage in physical exercise. It keeps your brain alert and your body fit to enjoy your success.  24. Pray often, and know that for every success, God made it possible.  Wishing you the very best in life. Practice what you just read, and see the difference your life would record in 2 years.

The song "It Is Well With My Soul" was written by a successful Christian lawyer Heratio Spafford. His only son died at age 4 in 1871. In 1872, the great Chicago fire wiped out his vast estate, made from a successful legal career. In 1873 he sent his wife & 4 daughters over to Europe on a summer trip on the ill fated SS Ville du Havre. Since he had a lot of work to do, he planned to follow them later. The Ship sank and he lost his 4 daughters with the wife being the only survivor. She sent him a famous telegram which simply read, "SAVED ALONE...."  On his return home, his Law firm was burned down and the insurance company refused to pay him. They said "It's an Act of God".  He had no money to pay for his house and no work, he also lost his house.  Then while sitting and thinking what's happening to him, being a spiritual person, he wrote a song - "Whatever, my Lord, You have taught me to say - It is well, it is well with my soul".  My dear friend, a good attitude will determine your altitude.  When you look at your life, career, job or family life, what do you say?  Do you praise God? Do you blame the devil?  A good attitude towards God makes Him move on your behalf.  Just sit down and say, "Today, God, it is well with my soul, I am thankful I had a peaceful sleep, I am thankful I am alive with possibilities, I am thankful I have a roof over me, I am thankful I have a job, I am thankful that I have Family and Friends.  Above all, I am thankful that I have the Lord Jesus Christ on my side."  Be blessed and don't be envious or shocked when others are prospering because you don't know what they have been through to get there (test, trials and tribulation) so thank God for what you have.  "Little is much when God is in it. It Is Well With My Soul! If God is for us, who can successfully be against us? No one!  The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of truth... Please, share to encourage others.
Thank you

ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬   DRUMS OF WAR. ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬  As ethnic lords from the North, East, West and South continue in efforts to trigger a second civil war, international military hardware merchants who brainwashed the foreign based agitators to employ an uncompromising attitude are instigating and preparing to sell their arms while we get our parents, wives and children ready to pay the bitter prices.  The gullible ones believe war is the answer and provoking same by their words and actions each passing day, the unwise ones are so selfish and inconsiderate, refusing to caution their people, thinking that their families or any part of the country will be immune to the consequences of a possible 2017 civil war simply because they didn't participate in the agitation.  Perhaps, many do not know that the Civil War didn't extend beyond Ore to the West and didn't exceed Benue to the North. At the very end, both gladiators (Gowon & Ojukwu) lived because they never set foot upon the battlefield of the wars they ignited but over three million innocent women, children and elderly died unnecessarily. Meanwhile, all the crooks travelled to safe areas with their families just as would repeat should another civil war breakout. Niger Delta militant generals are all alive but over 60% of their boys are dead, Al Zakzarki is alive but hundreds of his gullible followers are dead.  As you continue to conjure the next civil war, call for a town hall meeting in your respective communities and prepare the minds of your aged parents for a violent death, counsel your wives and daughters of the emotional trauma that incessant rapes would create because surely over 30% shall be raped in just 6mths of chaos. Also, make plans because most of your children shall become orphans and child soldiers and those who survive shall end up in REFUGEE Camps in Niger, Chad, Benin Republic and Cameroon.  The last Civil war was ignited on a conference table and was also resolved on a conference table, wouldn't it be wiser to have avoided the war in between.   Like and Share, we must not continue in silence until our loved ones become the collateral damage.please send it out to every one to read

*why invest in the lekki free trade zone?*        Given the abundance of resources and a fast growing trade economy in Africa, there is the need for deep seaports, airports, infrastructure and logistics in Africa. Countries like Nigeria have been in a struggle to capitalize on their economic growth but are being slowed by lack of basic and advanced logistical investment. Now all these are changing thanks to Foreign Investors in cooperation with the Nigerian Government building one free trade zone at a time.            The Nigerian Enterprises Promotional Agency has set out to create a plethora of free trade zone spread out across the country in hope of a repetition of Chinaâ€™s success story in Nigeria. The Chinese model-which came into action in 1988-saw the creation of several special economic zones that employed more flexible economic policies and government measures, in order to foster growth and foreign direct investment within those areas. This later led to the massive and expansive growth of economic centers such as Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen which have contributed to Chinaâ€™s accelerated increase in GDP[Gross Domestic Profit] on an annual basis in double digits. With a stagnated growth rate of 5% to 6% in Nigeriaâ€™s GDP, her authorities are pining to move her industries in leaps and bounds. This gave rise to the formation of free trade zones across Nigeria,with the biggest and most important-LEKKI FREE TRADE ZONE-located in the Countryâ€™s commercial capital city,Lagos.  *About Lekki Free Trade Zone*                                                                  Lekki FTZ is a free zone located at the eastern part of Lekki. It should be noted that Lekki covers 3 Local Government Areas namely Epe,Eti-osa and Ibeju-Lekki. It is located atop the Lekki Pennisula,the South East of Lagos State and borders the Lekki Lagoon in the North while it faces the Atlantic Ocean in the South with a beautiful Coast line of about 5km, making it the fastest growing axis in Nigeria. Out of the 23 free trade zones in Nigeria vying for the attention of foreign investors,The Lekki Free Trade Zone has attracted a consortium of Chinese investors indicative of international acceptability of Nigeria(The Free Trade Zone Axis) as a safe haven for investments. Apart from the 116 investors who registered to operate in the zone,there has been of recent additional 100 investors who have made known their intention to register and situate their businesses  within the zone.      The Lekki FTZ is the biggest in Africa and four times the size of Manhattan. The Lekki FTZ will have located within itself the free trade zone,The Deep Sea Port,The New International Airport,An International Golf Course,The Centre of Industrial and Employment Activities,The Oso Lekki Cultural Festival,Mega Power Plants amongst others.      According to the Master Plan,Lekki FTZ will be developed into a Modern Industrial Mega City In the Lagos Metropolis with the integration of industries,commerce and business,real estate development,warehousing and logistics,tourism and entertainment. Lekki FTZ is divided into 3 functional districts; The residential district in the North,Industrial district in the middle and commercial trading/warehousing and logistics district in the South East. The â€œsub centreâ€ located in the South of the Zone is to be developed first. This sub centre houses the deep sea port which is set to be completed within 41months-looking forward to 2020 as its completion year- as construction has commenced already in a bid to attract more investors to ensure return on investments. In the Start-up area of the Lekki FTZ,there will be a commercial and logistics park which covers a total area of 1.5 square kilometers . The park is planned to be multifunctional  integrating commerce,trading,warehousing and exhibition. The park will also house The International Commodities and Trade Centre,The International exhibition and Conversation Centre,industrial factory workshops,logistics warehouses,office buildings,residential apartments buildings,hotels amongst others.       The Lekki FTZ will  ensure a great shift of focus from dependency on oil and petroleum products to other sectors that also boost great economic growth namely manufacturing,industries,agri-commodities just to mention a few,also boost Nigeriaâ€™s employment sector by creating over 300,000 jobs with 20 million US Dollars to be invested on employeeâ€™s salaries. Given her masterplan and already progressing work,the Lekki FTZ will be a catalyst for economic development in Lagos State,Nigeria and in Africa as a whole.  *HOW TO INVEST AND WHY INVEST?*  Real Estate acquisition is one of the many numerous ways to invest and also buy into the Lekki FTZ dream boosting your bank accounts and also the countryâ€™s economy at the same time. Purchase and land acquisition could be in any of the functional districts of the Lekki FTZ depending on the immediate or future purpose in mind. The Lekki FTZ being the fastest growing axis in the sub-saharan Africa is boosting the Real Estate Sector in the same axis too. Living standards will be improved as a result of a boost of the countryâ€™s export to a steady phenomenal growth rate which will directly and indirectly  boost the Real Estate sector in Lekki FTZ axis.  *WHY INVEST*  1). The Lekki FTZ axis also known as the Ibeju-Lekki axis is the fastest growing area in the Sub-Saharan Africa. 2). Real Estate and Property having an amazing capital appreciation pegged to return more than 300% in 3 to 5 years. 3). The Master Plan has made adequate provision for a proper waste disposal system,independent power supply and distribution system, efficient storm water drainage system curbing storm water which has been responsible for devaluing and destroying properties across the Lagos Island. 4).Mouth-watering incentives such as; 100% tax holiday,100% ownership of investments,reduced custom duties and levies,complete waiver on export and import licences,no restriction on the hire of foreign employees.      If resources are available,see this as the next big step. O.J

*WHY YOU NEED TO THlNK DIFFERENTLY TO BECOME A MILLIONAIRE*                   *MONEY* Average people look for ways to spend money.

Millionaires know that investing is the key to abundance.                 *JOBS* Average people think a better job will make them wealthy. Millionaires know that a job will never make them wealthy; investment will.                     *RISK* Average people stay away from risk because they might fail. Millionaires know if they don't take risk, they have already failed.                *PROBLEMS* Average people try to avoid problems.

*My Ibeju-Lekki Creed*   *How well do you know Ibeju-lekki?*  *Let's study, recite and invest together!!*  Gradually but steadily, a new Bethlehem is evolving in Lagos, Nigeria known as Ibeju Lekki. Like the Biblical Bethlehem-the tiny, agrarian, sleepy and little known Jewish town where the meek and gentle Baby Jesus was born which later became a historical phenomenon by virtue of Christ's personality, saving grace and redemptive power, Ibeju Lekki is.........  The future of Lagos and same has given rise to real estates investment which lies in the Ibeju Lekki development and corridors.  Ibeju Lekki, is the newest development and is fifty kilometres from the city's centre. It borders Lekki Lagoon in the north and faces the Atlantic in the South. This area is fast developing and is offering unlimited opportunities to Estate developers, Water Transporters, Industrialists, Tourists and lots more.  Another great thing about this Ibeju-Lekki zone is that it has easy access to places like Epe, Ajah and Victoria Island.  It also promises ninety-nine years of lease alongside fifty years of concessionary right of the Zone's operation, tax free services and one stop approvals for all permit and operating licences.  There's some more great news; *the development will house the Lekki Free Trade Zone, a project that was approved by the Chinese Government in 2007 as one of the overseas economic and trade cooperation zones*  The Master Plan for Lekki FTZ is aimed at developing and turning the Zone into a modern satellite city of Lagos with new economic functions, urban service industries and real estate property development as the pillar so as to promote the overall industrial development of the Zone. It will be a place where major infrastructure amenities and other facilities are located.  When the development has been completed, Lekki Free Trade Zone would be turned into a modern satellite town that is an embodiment of industries and also a city full of life, vigour and modernization. It will become a driving force for Nigerian economic development and an example of the cooperation between China and Nigeria.  Some of the major infrastructure proposed for the area includes the International Airport, Access roads, Free Trade Zone, Right of Way, International Conference Centre etc.  There are also areas marked for private estate developments, schools, hospitals etc. There would also be a bridge to link Ibeju Lekki to Itoikin, a community that is along Ijebu-Ode-Epe Road.  *This is a call being made to all investors; hurry to Ibeju-Lekki and get your stake in it while you still can because a few years from now, it will be the centre hub of Lagos and it would be terrible to look back and say I wish*  For enquiries and plot bookings, pls call *080******

How bitconnect lending work?  Like what happen to your money at bank is similar to what is happening to your money on bitconnect lending.When you leave some money on your bank account, at the end of the month you receive some interest on your savings.your money is been used.  Bitcoin is known for it volatility and lot of money can be generated from this pump and dump.Bitconnect has made is easier for us by building a trading bot and bitcoin price volatility software.  The trading bot help to trade bitcoin while the bitcoin price volatility software monitor the price of bitcoin against USD. The software calculate the interest gain during the day trading and you receive based on your lending investment.  So by lending,trading bot borrow from you and interest is paid to you daily base on bitcoin market price and it is determine by bitcoin price volatility software  Interest accrue each day is not fixed because of bitcoin price market fluctuation.which means there will be some days that you will earn just 0.001% and another day may be 2% of your investment.  What they engage in is obvious and it has been a good investment so far.
The minimum you can lend is $100 and you capital stays in the system for 299 days.  Meanwhile, you will be paid daily till the end of the 299days.
You can withdraw your capital back after back after the contract is over. Just that Bitconnect pays ur capital back it $ value, not btc value. Meaning if you lend them $1000, no matter the value(rise/fall) of btc after 299days, they pay you exactly $1000(your capital)
Hmm dem don come again oðŸ˜ 
Who are they pls? @2348146237912
You can withdraw your reward anytime. Just that the minimum withdrawal is 0.005
This statement sounds like someone new to crypto world
Bitconnect is a decentralized crypocurrency on its own
Ok..
We have over 250 crypto coin. Bitcoin, litecoin, Bitcoin cash, Ripple, dogecoin, monero, Bitconnect, dash, Ethereum, Ethereum classic, argur, Gnosis, golem, status, civic.....
Meanwhile, Bitconnect comes with additional opportunities that include; lending, saving and exchanging on their platform
Bitconnect came into the limelight since Feb 9, 2016
There are some new coins that tries to imitate Bitconnect, but Bitconnect is the only trusted for now
You can run a critical review on Bitconnect through Google.
It's not compulsory you register through my link.  Sharing this is a selfless act to mine to let you know about the opportunity I've been enjoying for a while. Thanks
So like how much profit can u make e.g if u invest 100$ in 299days?
It varies. Mind you they use ur money to trade so one can't tell precisely what ur income will be
The rise nd fall of btc will always affect ur reward
I'll say between 25% to 40% a month
